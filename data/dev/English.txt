 "I’m afraid that’s impossible. There are at least five families who have not heard the news, and I feel that it is my bounden duty to enlighten them."  "You’re quite right, it is not often a man has such glorious vengeance to chronicle. It behooves you to make the most of it."  The other looked at Carne as if to discover whether or not he was laughing at him. Carne’s face, however, was quite expressionless.  "Goodbye; I suppose you won’t be at the Wilbringham’s tonight?"  "I’m afraid not. You evidently forget that, as I said just now, I have a very good and sufficient excuse."  When the front door had closed behind his guest, Carne lit a third cigar.  "I’m overstepping my allowance," he said reflectively, as he watched the smoke circle upward, "but it isn’t every day a man gives a thousand pounds for a wedding present and gets upwards of seventy thousand back. I think I may congratulate myself on having brought off a very successful little speculation."      *CHAPTER VII.*   *THE MAN OF MANY CRIMES.*   If one consults a dictionary one finds that the word dipsomaniac means a man who spends his life continually desiring alcoholic liquor; a name that properly classifies it has not yet been invented for the individual who exhibits a perpetual craving for notoriety, and yet one is, perhaps, as much a nuisance to society as the other. After his run of success there came a time when Simon Carne, like Alexander the Great, could have sat down and wept, for the reason that he had no more worlds to conquer. For the moment it seemed as if he had exhausted, to put it plainly, every species of artistic villainy.  He had won the Derby, under peculiar circumstances, as narrated elsewhere; he had rendered a signal though an unostentatious service to the State; he had stolen, under enormous difficulty, the most famous family jewels in Europe; and he had relieved the most fashionable bride and bridegroom of the season of the valuable presents that their friends and relations had lavished on them.  On a morning following a banquet at the Mansion House, at which he had been a welcome, as well as a conspicuous guest, he was sitting alone in his study smoking a meditative cigar. Though the world would scarcely have thought it, a fashionable life did not suit him, and he was beginning to wonder whether he was not, after all, a little tired of England. He was hungering for the warmth and color of the East, and, perhaps, if the truth must be told, for something of the rest he had known in the Maharajah of Kadir’s lake palace, where he had been domiciled when he had first made the acquaintance of the man who had been his sponsor in English society, the Earl of Amberley.  It was a strange coincidence that, while he was thinking of that nobleman, and of the events which had followed the introduction just referred to, his quick ears should have caught the sound of a bell that was destined eventually to lead him up to one of the most sensational adventures of all his sensational career. A moment later his butler entered to inform him that Lady Caroline Weltershall and the Earl of Amberley had called, and would like to see him. Tossing his cigar into the grate, he passed through the door Ram Gafur held open for him, and, having crossed the hall, entered the drawingroom.  As he went he wondered what it was that had brought them to see him at such an early hour. Both were among his more intimate acquaintances and both occupied distinguished positions in the social life of the world’s great metropolis. While her friends and relations spent their time in search of amusement, and a seemingly eternal round of gaieties, which involved a waste of both health and money, Lady Caroline, who was the ugly duckling of an otherwise singularly handsome family, put her life to a different use.  Philanthropy was her hobby, and scarcely a day passed in which she did not speak at some meeting, preside over some committee, or endeavor in some way, as she somewhat grandiloquently put it: "To better the lives and ameliorate the conditions of our less fortunate fellowcreatures." In appearance she was a short, fair woman, of about fortyfive years of age, with a not unhandsome face, the effect of which, however, was completely spoilt by two large and protruding teeth.  "My dear Lady Caroline, this is indeed kind of you," said Carne, as he shook hands with her, "and also of you, Lord Amberley. To what happy circumstance may I attribute the pleasure of this visit?"  "I fear it is dreadfully early for us to come to see you," replied her ladyship, "but Lord Amberley assured me that as our business is so pressing you would forgive us."  "Pray do not apologize," returned Carne. "It gives me the greatest possible pleasure to see you. As for the hour, I am ashamed to confess that, while the morning is no longer young, I have only just finished breakfast. But won’t you sit down?"  They seated themselves once more, and when they had done so, Lady Caroline unfolded her tale.  "As you are perhaps aware, my friends say that I never come to see them unless it is to attempt to extort money from them for some charitable purpose," she said. "No, you need not prepare to button up your pockets, Mr. Carne. I am not going to ask you for anything today. What I _do_ want, however, is to endeavor to persuade you to help us in a movement we are inaugurating to raise money with which to relieve the great distress in the Canary Islands, brought about by the late disastrous earthquake. My cousin, the Marquis of Laverstock, has kindly promised to act as president, and, although we started it but yesterday, ten thousand pounds have already been subscribed. As you are aware, however, if we are to attract public attention and support, the funds raised must be representative of all classes. Our intention, therefore, is to hold a drawingroom meeting at my house tomorrow afternoon, when a number of the most prominent people of the day will be invited to give us their views upon the subject.  "I feel sure, if you will only consent to throw in your lot with us, and to assist in carrying out what we have in view, we shall be able to raise a sum of at least one hundred thousand pounds for the benefit of the sufferers. Our kind friend here, Lord Amberley, has promised to act as secretary, and his efforts will be invaluable to us. Royalty has signified its gracious approval, and it is expected will head the list with a handsome donation. Every class will be appealed to. Ministers of religion, of all known denominations, will be invited to cooperate, and if you will only consent to allow your name to appear upon the personnel of the committee, and will allow us to advertise your name as a speaker at tomorrow’s meeting, I feel sure there is nothing we shall not be able to achieve."  "I shall be delighted to help you in any way I can," Carne replied. "If my name is likely to be of any assistance to you, I beg you will make use of it. In the meantime, if you will permit me, I will forward you a cheque for one thousand pounds, being my contribution to the fund you have so charitably started."  Her ladyship beamed with delight, and even Lord Amberley smiled gracious approval.  "You are generous, indeed," said Lady Caroline. "I only wish others would imitate your example."  She did not say that, wealthy though she herself was, she had only contributed ten pounds to the fund. It is well known that while she inaugurated large works of charity, she seldom contributed very largely to them. As a wit once remarked: "Philanthropy was her virtue, and meanness was her vice."  "Egad," said Amberley, "if you’re going to open your pursestrings like that, Carne, I shall feel called upon to do the same."  "Then let me have the pleasure of booking both amounts at once," cried her ladyship, at the same time whipping out her notebook and pencil with flattering alacrity.  "I shall be delighted," said Carne, with a smile of eagerness.  "I also," replied Amberley, and in a trice both amounts were written down. Having gained her point, her ladyship rose to say goodbye. Lord Amberley immediately imitated her example.  "You will not forget, will you, Mr. Carne?" she said. "I am to have the pleasure of seeing you at my house tomorrow afternoon at three o’clock. We shall look forward to hearing your speech, and I need not remind you that every word you utter will be listened to with the closest attention."  "At three tomorrow afternoon," said Carne, "I shall be at your house. You need have no fear that I shall forget. And now, since you think you must be going, goodbye, and many thanks to you for asking me."  He escorted them to the carriage which was waiting outside, and when he had watched it drive away, returned to his study to write the cheque he had promised her. Having done so, he did not rise from his chair, but continued to sit at his writingtable biting the feather of his quill pen and staring at the blotting pad before him. A great and glorious notion had suddenly come into his head, and the majesty of it was for the moment holding him spellbound.  "If only it could be worked," he said to himself, "what a glorious _coup_ it would be. The question for my consideration is, can it be done? To invite the people of England to subscribe its pounds, shillings, and pence for my benefit, would be a glorious notion, and just the sort of thing I should enjoy. Besides which I have to remember that I am a thousand pounds to the bad already, and that must come back from somewhere. For the present, however I’ll put the matter aside. After the meeting tomorrow I shall have something tangible to go upon, and then, if I still feel in the same mind, it will be strange if I can’t find some way of doing what I want. In the meantime I shall have to think out my speech; upon that will depend a good deal of my success. It is a strange world in which it is ordained that so much should depend upon so little!"  At five minutes to three o’clock on the following afternoon Simon Carne might have been observedthat, I believe, is the correct expressionstrolling across from Apsley House to Gloucester Place. Reaching Lord Weltershall’s residence, he discovered a long row of carriages lining the pavement, and setting down their occupants at his lordship’s door. Carne followed the stream into the house, and was carried by it up the stairs towards the large drawingroom where the meeting was to be held. Already about a hundred persons were present, and it was evident that, if they continued to arrive at the same rate, it would not be long before the room would be filled to overflowing. Seeing Lady Caroline bidding her friends welcome near the door, Carne hastened to shake hands with her.  "It is so very good of you to come," she said, as she took his hand. "Remember, we are looking to you for a rousing speech this afternoon. We want one that will inflame all England, and touch the heartstrings of every man and woman in the land."  "To touch their pursestrings would, perhaps, be more to the point," said Carne, with one of his quiet smiles.  "Let us hope we shall touch them, too," she replied. "Now would you mind going to the dais at the other end of the room? You will find Lord Laverstock there, talking to my husband, I think."  Carne bowed, and went forward as he had been directed.  So soon as it was known that the celebrities had arrived, the meeting was declared open and the speechmaking commenced. Clever as some of them were it could not be doubted that Carne’s address was the event of the afternoon. He was a born speaker, and what was more, despite the short notice he had received, had made himself thoroughly conversant with his subject. His handsome face was on fire with excitement, and his sonorous voice rang through the large room like a trumpet call. When he sat down it was amidst a burst of applause. Lord Laverstock leant forward and shook hands with him.  "Your speech will be read all over England tomorrow morning," he said. "It should make a difference of thousands of pounds to the fund. I congratulate you most heartily upon it."  Simon Carne felt that if it was really going to make that difference he might, in the light of future events, heartily congratulate himself. He, however, accepted the praise showered upon him with becoming modesty, and, during the next speaker’s exhibition of halting elocution, amused himself watching the faces before him, and speculating as to what they would say when the surprise he was going to spring upon them became known. Halfanhour later, when the committee had been elected and the meeting had broken up, he bade his friends goodbye and set off on his return home. That evening he was dining at home, intending to call at his club afterwards, and to drop in at a reception and two dances between ten and midnight. After dinner, however, he changed his mind, and having instructed Ram Gafur to deny him to all callers, and countermanding his order for his carriage, went to his study, where he locked himself in and sat down to smoke and think.  He had set himself a puzzle which would have taxed the brain of that arch schemer Machiavelli himself. He was not, however, going to be beaten by it. There must be some way, he told himself, in which the fraud could be worked, and if there was he was going to find it. Numberless were the plans he formed, only to discover a few moments later that some little difficulty rendered each impracticable.  Suddenly, throwing down the pencil with which he had been writing, he sprang to his feet and began eagerly to pace the room. It was evident, from the expression upon his face, that he had touched upon a train of thought that was at last likely to prove productive. Reaching the fireplace for about the thirtieth time, he paused and gazed into the fireless grate. After standing there for a few moments he turned, and, with his hands in his pockets, said solemnly to himself: "Yes, I think it can be done!"  Whatever the train of thought may have been that led him to make this declaration, it was plain that it afforded him no small amount of satisfaction. He did not, however, commit himself at once to a decision, but continued to think over the scheme he had hit upon until he had completely mastered it. It was nearly midnight before he was thoroughly satisfied. Then he followed his invariable practice on such occasions, and rang for the inimitable Belton. When he had admitted him to the room, he bade him close and lock the door behind him.  By the time this had been done he had lit a fresh cigar, and had once more taken up his position on the hearthrug.  "I sent for you to say that I have just made up my mind to try a little scheme, compared with which all I have done so far will sink into insignificance."  "What is it, sir?" asked Belton.  "I will tell you, but you must not look so terrified. Put in a few words, it is neither more nor less than to attempt to divert the enormous sums of money which the prodigal English public is taking out of its pocket in order to assist the people of the Canary Islands, who have lost so severely by the recent terrible earthquake, into my own."  Belton’s face expressed his astonishment.  "But, my dear sir," he said, "that’s a fund of which the Marquis of Laverstock is president, and of whose committee you are one of the principal members."  "Exactly," answered Carne. "It is to those two happy circumstances I shall later on attribute the success I now mean to attain. Lord Laverstock is merely a pompous old nobleman, whose hobby is philanthropy. This lesson will do him good. It will be strange if, before I am a week older, I cannot twist him round my finger. Now for my instructions. In the first place, you must find me a moderatesized house, fit for an elderly lady, and situated in a fairly fashionable quarter, say South Kensington. Furnish it on the hire system from one of the big firms, and engage three servants who can be relied upon to do their work and, what is more important, who can hold their tongues.  "Next find me an old lady to impersonate the mistress of the house. She must be very frail and delicatelooking, and you will arrange with some livery stable people in the neighborhood to supply her with a carriage, in which she will go for an airing every afternoon in order that the neighborhood may become familiar with her personality. Both she and the servants must be made to thoroughly understand that their only chance of obtaining anything from me depends upon their carrying out my instructions to the letter. Also, while they are in the house, they must keep themselves to themselves. My identity, of course, must not transpire.  "As soon as I give the signal, the old lady must keep to the house, and the neighborhood must be allowed to understand that she is seriously ill. The day following she will be worse, and the next she will be dead. You will then make arrangements for the funeral, order a coffin, and arrange for the conveyance of the body to Southampton, _en route_ for the Channel Islands, where she is to be buried. At Southampton a yacht, which I will arrange for myself, will be in readiness to carry us out to sea. Do you think you understand?"  "Perfectly, sir," Belton replied, "but I wish I could persuade you to give up the attempt. You will excuse my saying so, sir, I hope, but it does seem to me a pity, when you have done so much, to risk losing it all over such a dangerous bit of business as this. It surely can’t succeed, sir?"  "Belton," said Carne very seriously, "you strike me as being in a strange humor tonight, and I cannot say that I like it. Were it not that I have the most implicit confidence in you, I should begin to think you were turning honest. In that case our connection would be likely to be a very short one."  "I hope, sir," Belton answered in alarm, "that you still believe I am as devoted as ever to your interests."  "I do believe it," Carne replied. "Let the manner in which you carry out the various instructions I have just given you, confirm me in that belief. This is Wednesday. I shall expect you to come to me on Saturday with a report that the house has been taken and furnished, and that the servants are installed and the delicate old lady in residence."  "You may rely upon my doing my best, sir."  "I feel sure of that," said Carne, "and now that all is arranged I think I will go to bed."  A week later a committee of the Canary Island Relief Fund was able to announce to the world, through the columns of the Daily Press, that the generous public of England had subscribed no less a sum than one hundred thousand pounds for the relief of the sufferers by the late earthquake. The same day Carne attended a committee meeting in Gloucester Place. A proposition advanced by Lady Weltershall and seconded by Simon Carne was carried unanimously. It was to the effect that in a week’s time such members of the Relief Committee as could get away should start for the scene of the calamity in the chairman’s yacht, which had been placed at their disposal, taking with them, for distribution among the impoverished inhabitants of the Islands, the sum already subscribed, namely, one hundred thousand pounds in English gold. They would then be able, with the assistance of the English Consul, to personally superintend the distribution of their money, and also be in a position to report to the subscribers, when they returned to England, the manner in which the money had been utilized.  "In that case," said Carne, who had not only seconded the motion, but had put the notion into Lady Weltershall’s head, "it might be as well if our chairman would interview the authorities of the bank, and arrange that the amount in question shall be packed, ready for delivery to the messengers he may select to call for it before the date in question."  "I will make it my business to call at the bank tomorrow morning," replied the chairman, "and perhaps you, Mr. Carne, would have no objection to accompany me."  "If it will facilitate the business of this committee I shall be only too pleased to do so," said Carne, and so it was settled.  On a Tuesday afternoon, six days later, and two days before the date upon which it had been arranged that the committee should sail, the Marquis of Laverstock received a letter. Lady Caroline Weltershall, the Earl of Amberley, and Simon Carne were with him when he opened it. He read it through, and then read it again, after which he turned to his guests.  "This is really a very extraordinary communication," he said, "and it affects the matter we have most at heart, perhaps I had better read it to you:   "_154, Great Chesterton Street,_  _Tuesday Evening._  To the Most Noble the Marquis of Laverstock, K. G., Berkeley Square.  "MY LORDAs one who has been permitted to enjoy a long and peaceful life in a country where such visitations are happily unknown, I take the liberty of writing to your Lordship to say how very much I should like to subscribe to the fund so nobly started by you and your friends to assist the poor people who have lost so much by the earthquake in the Canary Islands. Being a lonely old woman, blessed by Providence with some small share of worldly wealth, I feel it my duty to make some small sacrifice to help others who have not been so blessed.  "Unfortunately, I do not enjoy very good health, but if your Lordship could spare a moment to call upon me, I would like to thank you in the name of Womanhood, for all you have done, and, in proof of my gratitude, would willingly give you my cheque for the sum of ten thousand pounds to add to the amount already subscribed. I am permitted by my doctors to see visitors between the hours of eleven and twelve in the morning, and five and six in the afternoon. I should then be both honored and pleased to see your Lordship.  "Trusting you will concede me this small favor, I have the honor to be,  Yours very sincerely,  "JANET O’HALLORAN."   There was a momentary pause after his lordship had finished reading the letter.  "What will you do?" inquired Lady Caroline.  "It is a noble offering," put in Simon Carne.  "I think there cannot be two opinions as to what is my duty," replied the chairman. "I shall accede to her request, though why she wants to see me is more than I can tell."  "As she hints in the letter, she wishes to congratulate you personally on what you have done," continued the Earl of Amberley; "and as it will be the handsomest donation we have yet received, it will, perhaps, be as well to humor her."  "In that case I will do as I say, and make it my business to call there this afternoon between five and six. And now it is my duty to report to you that Mr. Simon Carne and I waited upon the authorities at the bank this morning, and have arranged that the sum of one hundred thousand pounds in gold shall be ready for our messengers when they call for it, either tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon at latest."  "It is a large sum to take with us," said Lady Caroline. "I trust it will not prove a temptation to thieves!"  "You need have no fear on that score," replied his lordship. "As I have explained to the manager, my own trusted servants will effect the removal of the money, accompanied by two private detectives, who will remain on board my yacht until we weigh anchor. We have left nothing to chance. To make the matter doubly sure, I have also arranged that the money shall not be handed over except to a person who shall present my cheque, and at the same time show this signet ring which I now wear upon my finger."  The other members of the committee expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with this arrangement, and when certain other business had been transacted the meeting broke up.  As soon as he left Berkeley Square Carne returned with all haste to Porchester House. Reaching his study he ordered that Belton should be at once sent to him.  "Now, Belton," he said, when the latter stood before him, "there is not a moment to lose. Lord Laverstock will be at Great Chesterton Street in about two hours. Send a messenger to Waterloo to inquire if they can let us have a special train at seven o’clock to take a funeral party to Southampton. Use the name of Merryburn, and you may say that the amount of the charge, whatever it may be, will be paid before the train starts. As soon as you obtain a reply, bring it to Great Chesterton Street. In the meantime I shall disguise myself and go on to await you there. On the way I shall wire to the captain of the yacht at Southampton to be prepared for us. Do you understand what you have to do?"  "Perfectly, sir," Belton replied. "But I must confess that I am very nervous."  "There is no need to be. Mark my words, everything will go like clockwork. Now I am going to change my things and prepare for the excursion."  He would have been a sharp man who would have recognized in the dignifiedlooking clergyman who drove up in a hansom to Great Chesterton Street, halfanhour later, Simon Carne, who had attended the committee meeting of the Canary Island Relief Fund that afternoon. As he alighted he looked up, and saw that all the blinds were drawn down, and that there were evident signs that Death had laid his finger on the house. Having dismissed his cab he rang the bell, and when the door was opened entered the house. The butler who admitted him had been prepared for coming. He bowed respectfully, and conducted him into the drawingroom. There he found an intensely respectable lady, attired in black silk, seated beside the window.  "Go upstairs," he said peremptorily, "and remain in the room above this until you are told to come down. Be careful not to let yourself be seen. As soon as it gets dark tonight you can leave the house, but not till then. Before you go the money promised you will be paid. Now be off upstairs, and make sure that some of the neighbors catch sight of you."  Ten minutes later a man, who might have been a retired military officer, and who was dressed in the deepest black, drove up, and was admitted to the house. Though no one would have recognized him, Carne addressed him at once as "Belton."  "What have you arranged about the train?" he asked, as soon as they were in the drawingroom together.  "I have settled that it shall be ready to start for Southampton punctually at seven o’clock," the other answered.  "And what about the hearse?"  "It will be here at a quarter to seven, without fail."  "Very good; we will have the corpse ready meanwhile. Now, before you do anything else, have the two lower blinds in the front room drawn up. If he thinks there is trouble in the house he may take fright, and we must not scare our bird away after all the bother we have had to lure him here."  For the next hour they were busily engaged perfecting their arrangements. These were scarcely completed before a gorgeous landau drove up to the house, and Belton reported that the footman had alighted and was ascending the steps.  "Let his lordship be shown into the drawingroom," said Simon Carne, "and as soon as he is there do you, Belton, wait at the door. I’ll call you when I want you."  Carne went into the drawingroom and set the door ajar. As he did so he heard the footman inquire whether Mrs. O’Halloran was at home, and whether she would see his master. The butler answered in the affirmative, and a few moments later the Marquis ascended the steps.  "Will you be pleased to step this way my lord," said the servant. "My mistress is expecting you, and will see you at once."  When he entered the drawingroom he discovered the same portly, dignified clergyman whom the neighbors had seen enter the house an hour or so before, standing before the fireplace.  "Goodafternoon, my lord," said this individual as the door closed behind the butler. "If you will be good enough to take a seat, Mrs. O’Halloran will be down in a few moments."  His lordship did as he was requested, and while doing so commented on the weather, and allowed his eyes to wander round the room. He took in the grand piano, the easy chairs on either side of the bookcase, and the flowerstand in the window. He could see that there was plain evidence of wealth in these things. What his next thought would have been can only be conjectured, for he was suddenly roused from his reverie by hearing the man say in a gruff voice: "it’s all up, my lord. If you move or attempt to cry out, you’re a dead man!"  Swinging round he discovered a revolver barrel pointed at his head. He uttered an involuntary cry of alarm, and made as if he would rise.  "Sit down, sir," said the clergyman authoritatively. "Are you mad that you disobey me? You do not know with whom you are trifling."  "What do you mean?" cried the astonished peer, his eyes almost starting from his head. "I demand to be told what this behavior means. Are you aware who I am?"  "Perfectly," the other replied. "As to your other question, you will know nothing more than I choose to tell you. What’s more, I should advise you to hold your tongue, unless you desire to be gagged. That would be unpleasant for all parties."  Then, turning to the door, he cried: "Come in, Dick!"  A moment later the military individual, who had been to Waterloo to arrange about the train, entered the room to find the Most Noble the Marquis of Laverstock seated in an easy chair, almost beside himself with terror, with the venerable clergyman standing over him revolver in hand.  "Dick, my lad," said the latter quietly, "his lordship has been wise enough to hear reason. No, sir, thank you, your hands behind your back, as arranged, if you please. If you don’t obey me I shall blow your brains out, and it would be a thousand pities to spoil this nice Turkey carpet. That’s right. Now, Dick, my lad, I want his lordship’s pocketbook from his coat and those sheets of notepaper and envelopes we brought with us. I carry a stylographic pen myself, so there is no need of ink."  These articles having been obtained, they were placed on a table beside him, and Carne took possession of the pocketbook. He leisurely opened it, and from it took the cheque for one hundred thousand pounds, signed by the chairman and committee of the Canary Island Relief Fund, which had been drawn that afternoon.  "Now take the pen," he said, "and begin to write. Endeavor to remember that I am in a hurry, and have no time to waste. Let the first letter be to the bank authorities. Request them, in your capacity of Chairman of the Relief Fund, to hand to the bearers the amount of the cheque in gold."  "I will do no such thing," cried the old fellow sturdily. "Nothing shall induce me to assist you in perpetrating such a fraud."  "I am sorry to hear that," said Carne sweetly, "for I am afraid in that case we shall be compelled to make you submit to a rather unpleasant alternative. Come, sir, I will give you three minutes in which to write that letter. If at the end of that time you have not done so, I shall proceed to drastic measures."  So saying, he thrust the poker into the fire in a highly suggestive manner. Needless to say, within the time specified the letter had been written, placed in its envelope, and directed.  "Now I shall have to trouble you to fill in this telegraph form to your wife, to tell her that you have been called out of town, and do not expect to be able to return until tomorrow."  The other wrote as directed, and when he had done so Carne placed this paper also in his pocket.  "Now I want that signet ring upon your finger, if you please."  The old gentleman handed it over to his persecutor with a heavy sigh. He had realized that it was useless to refuse.  "Now that wineglass on the sideboard, Dick," said the clergyman, "also that carafe of water. When you have given them to me, go and see that the others things I spoke to you about are ready."  Having placed the articles in question upon the table Belton left the room. Carne immediately filled the glass, into which he poured about a tablespoonful of some dark liquid from a bottle which he took from his pocket, and which he had brought with him for that purpose.  "I’ll have to trouble you to drink this, my lord," he said, as he stirred the contents of the glass with an ivory paper knife taken from the table. "You need have no fear. It is perfectly harmless, and will not hurt you."  "I will not touch it," replied the other. "Nothing you can do or say will induce me to drink a drop of it."  Carne examined his watch ostentatiously.  "Time flies, I regret to say," he answered impressively, "and I cannot stay to argue the question with you. I will give you three minutes to do as I have ordered you. If you have not drunk it by that time we shall be compelled to repeat the little persuasion we tried with such success a few moments since."  "You wish to kill me," cried the other. "I will not drink it. I will not be murdered. You are a fiend to attempt such a thing."  "I regret to say you are wasting time," replied his companion. "I assure you if you drink it you will not be hurt. It is merely an opiate intended to put you to sleep until we have time to get away in safety. Come, that delightful poker is getting hot again, and if you do not do what I tell you, trouble will ensue. Think well before you refuse."  There was another pause, during which the unfortunate nobleman gazed first at the poker, which had been thrust between the bars of the grate and then at the relentless being who stood before him, revolver in hand. Never had a member of the House of Lords been placed in a more awkward and unenviable position.  "One minute," said Carne quietly.  There was another pause, during which the Marquis groaned in a heartrending manner. Carne remembered with a smile that the family title had been bestowed upon one of the Marquis’ ancestors for bravery on the field of battle.  "Two minutes!"  As he spoke he stooped and gave the poker a little twist.  "Three minutes!"  The words were scarce out of his mouth before Lord Laverstock threw up his hands.  "You are a heartless being to make me, but I will drink," he cried, and with an ashened face he immediately swallowed the contents of the glass.  "Thank you," said Carne politely.  The effect produced by the drug was almost instantaneous. A man could scarcely have counted a hundred before the old gentleman, who had evidently resigned himself to his fate, laid himself back in his chair and was fast asleep.  "He has succumbed even quicker than I expected," said Carne to himself as he bent over the prostrate figure and listened to his even breathing. "It is, perhaps, just as well that this drug is not known in England. At any rate, on this occasion it has answered my purpose most admirably."  At five minutes before seven o’clock a hearse containing the mortal remains of Mrs. O’Halloran, of Great Chesterton Street, South Kensington, entered the yard of Waterloo Station, accompanied by a hansom cab. A special train was in waiting to convey the party, which consisted of the deceased’s brother, a retired Indian officer, and her cousin, the vicar of a Somersetshire parish, to Southampton, where a steam yacht would transport them to Guernsey, in which place the remains were to be interred beside those of her late husband.  "I think we may congratulate ourselves, Belton, on having carried it out most successfully," said Carne when the coffin had been carried on board the yacht and placed in the saloon. "As soon as we are under weigh we’ll have this lid off and get the poor old gentleman out. He has had a good spell of it in there, but he may congratulate himself that the ventilating arrangements of his temporary home were so perfectly attended to. Otherwise I should have trembled for the result."  A few hours later, having helped his guest to recover consciousness, and having seen him safely locked up in a cabin on board, the yacht put in at a little seaport town some thirty or forty miles from Southampton Water, and landed two men in time to catch the midnight express to London. The following afternoon they rejoined the yacht a hundred miles or so further down the coast. When they were once more out at sea Carne called the skipper to his cabin.  "How has your prisoner conducted himself during our absence?" he asked. "Has he given any trouble?  "Not a bit," replied the man. "The poor old buffer’s been too sick to make a row. He sent away his breakfast and his lunch untouched. The only thing he seems to care about is champagne, and that he drinks by the bottlefull. I never saw a better man at his bottle in all my life."  It was well after ten o’clock that evening when Simon Carne, still attired as a respectable Church of England clergyman, unlocked the door and entered his prisoner’s cabin.  "You will be glad to hear, my lord," he said, "that your term of imprisonment has at last come to an end. You had better get up and dress, for a boat will be alongside in twenty minutes to take you ashore."  The unfortunate gentleman needed no second bidding. Ill as he had hitherto been, he seemed to derive new life from the other’s words. At any rate, he sprang out of his bunk, and set to work to dress with feverish energy. All the time Carne sat and watched him with an amused smile upon his face. So soon as he was ready, and the captain had knocked at the door, he was conducted to the deck and ordered to descend into a shore boat, which had come off in answer to a signal and was now lying alongside in readiness.  Carne and Belton leant over the bulwarks to watch him depart.  "Goodbye, my lord," cried the former, as the boat moved away. "It has been a sincere pleasure to me to entertain you, and I only hope that, in return, you have enjoyed your little excursion. You might give my respectful compliments to the members of the Canary Island Relief Fund, and tell them that there is at least one person on board this yacht who appreciates their kindly efforts."  Then his lordship stood up, and shook his fist at the yacht until it had faded away, and could no longer be seen owing to the darkness. Presently Carne turned to Belton.  "So much for the Most Noble the Marquis of Laverstock," he said, "and the Canary Island Relief Fund. Now, let us be off to town. Tomorrow I must be Simon Carne once more."  Next morning Simon Carne arose from his couch, in his luxurious bedroom, a little later than usual. He knew he should be tired, and had instructed Belton not to come in until he rang his bell. When the latter appeared he bade him bring in the morning papers. He found what he wanted in the first he opened, on the middle page, headed with three lines of large type:    GIGANTIC SWINDLE.   THE MARQUIS OF LAVERSTOCK ABDUCTED.  THE CANARY ISLAND FUND STOLEN.   "This looks quite interesting," said Carne, as he folded the paper in order to be able the better to read the account. "As I know something of the case I shall be interested to see what they have to say about it. Let me see."  The newspaper version ran as follows:  "Of all the series of extraordinary crimes which it has been our unfortunate duty to chronicle during this year of great rejoicing, it is doubtful whether a more impudent robbery has been perpetrated than that which we have to place before our readers this morning. As every one is well aware, a large fund has been collected from all classes for the relief of the sufferers by the recent Canary Island earthquake. On the day before the robbery took place this fund amounted to no less a sum than one hundred thousand pounds, and tomorrow it was the intention of the committee under the presidency of the Most Noble the Marquis of Laverstock to proceed to the seat of the disaster, taking with them the entire amount of the sum raised in English gold. Unfortunately for the success of this scheme, his lordship was the recipient, two days ago, of a letter from a person purporting to reside in Great Chesterton Street, South Kensington. She signed herself Janet O’Halloran, and offered to add a sum of ten thousand pounds to the amount already collected, provided the Marquis would call and collect her cheque personally. The excuse given for this extraordinary stipulation was that she wished to convey to him her thanks for the trouble he had taken.  "Accordingly, feeling that he had no right to allow such a chance to slip, his lordship visited the house. He was received in the drawingroom by a man dressed in the garb of a clergyman, who, assisted by a militarylooking individual, presently clapped a revolver to his head and demanded, under the threat of all sorts of penalties, that he should give up to him the cheque drawn upon the bank, and which it was the Marquis’s intention to have cashed the following morning. Not satisfied with this assurance, he was also made to write an order to the banking authorities authorizing them to pay over the money to the bearer, who was a trusted agent, while at the same time he was to supply them with his signet ring, which, as had already been arranged, would prove that the messengers were genuine and what they pretended to be. Next he was ordered to drink a powerful opiate, and after that his lordship remembers nothing more until he awoke to find himself on board a small yacht in midchannel. Despite the agony he was suffering, he was detained on board this piratical craft until late last night, when he was set ashore at a small village within a few miles of Plymouth. Such is his lordship’s story. The sequel to the picture is as follows:  "Soon after the bank was opened yesterday, a respectablelooking individual, accompanied by three others, who were introduced to the manager as private detectives, put in an appearance and presented the Relief Fund’s cheque at the counter. In reply to inquiries the letter written by the Marquis was produced, and the signet ring shown. Never for a moment doubting that these were the messengers the bank had all along been told to expect, the money was handed over and placed in a handsome private omnibus which was waiting outside. It was not until late last night, when a telegram was received from the Marquis of Laverstock from Plymouth, that the nature of the gigantic fraud which had been perpetrated was discovered. The police authorities were immediately communicated with and the matter placed in their hands. Unfortunately, however, so many hours had been allowed to elapse that it was extremely difficult to obtain any clue that might ultimately lead to the identification of the parties concerned in the fraud. So far the case bids fair to rank with those other mysterious robberies which, during the last few months, have shocked and puzzled all England."  "I regard that as a remarkably able exposition of the case," said Carne to himself with a smile as he laid the paper down, "but what an account the man would be able to write if only he could know what is in my safe upstairs!"  That afternoon he attended a committee meeting of the fund at Weltershall House. The unfortunate nobleman whose unpleasant experience had founded the subject of this story was present. Carne was among the first to offer him an expression of sympathy.  "I don’t know that I ever heard of a more outrageous case," he said. "I only hope that the scoundrels may be soon brought to justice."  "In the meantime what about the poor people we intended to help?" asked Lady Weltershall.  "They shall not lose," replied Lord Laverstock. "I shall refund the entire amount myself."  "No, no, my lord; that would be manifestly unfair," said Simon Carne. "We are all trustees of the fund and what happened is as much our faults as yours. If nine other people will do the same I am prepared to contribute a sum of ten thousand pounds towards the fund."  "I will follow your example," said the Marquis.  "I also," continued Lord Amberley.  By nightfall seven other gentleman had done the same, and, as Simon Carne said as he totalled the amounts: "By this means the Canary Islanders will not be losers after all."      *CHAPTER VIII.*   *AN IMPERIAL FINALE.*   Of all the functions that ornament the calendar of the English social and sporting year, surely the Lowes week may claim to rank as one of the greatest, or at least the most enjoyable. So thought Simon Carne as he sat on the deck of Lord Tremorden’s yacht, anchored off the mouth of the Medina River, smoking his cigarette and whispering soft nothings into the shelllike ear of Lady Mabel Madderley, the lady of all others who had won the right to be considered the beauty of the past season. It was a perfect afternoon, and, as if to fill his flagon of enjoyment to the very brim, he had won the Queen’s Cup with his yacht, _The Unknown Quantity_, only halfanhour before. Small wonder, therefore, that he was contented with his lot in life, and his good fortune of that afternoon in particular.  The tiny harbor was crowded with shipping of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, including the guardship, his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Westphalia’s yacht the _Hohenzrallas_, the English Royal yachts, steam yachts, schooners, cutters, and all the various craft taking part in England’s greatest water carnival. Steam launches darted hither and thither, smartlyequipped gigs conveyed gailydressed parties from vessel to vessel, while, ashore the little town itself was alive with bunting, and echoed to the strains of almost continuous music.  "Surely you ought to consider yourself a very happy man, Mr. Carne," said Lady Mabel Madderley with a smile, in reply to a speech of the other’s. "You won the Derby in June, and today you have appropriated the Queen’s Cup."  "If such things constitute happiness I suppose I must be in the seventh heaven of delight," answered Carne, as he took another cigarette from his case and lit it. "All the same, I am insatiable enough to desire still greater fortune. When one has set one’s heart upon winning something, besides which the Derby and the Queen’s Cup are items scarcely worth considering, one is rather apt to feel that Fortune has still much to give."  "I am afraid I do not quite grasp your meaning," she said. But there was a look in her face that told him that, if she did not understand, she could at least make a very good guess. According to the world’s reckoning, he was quite the best fish then swimming in the matrimonial pond, and some people, for the past few weeks, had even gone so far as to say that she had hooked him. It could not be denied that he had been paying her unmistakable attention of late.  What answer he would have vouchsafed to her speech it is impossible to say for at that moment their host came along the deck towards them. He carried a note in his hand.  "I have just received a message to say that His Imperial Majesty is going to honor us with a visit," he said, when he reached them. "If I mistake not, that is his launch coming towards us now."  Lady Mabel and Simon Carne rose and accompanied him to the starboard bulwarks. A smart white launch with the Westphalian flag flying at her stern, had left the Royal yacht and was steaming quickly towards them. A few minutes later it had reached the companion ladder, and Lord Tremorden had descended to welcome his Royal guest. When they reached the deck together, his Majesty shook hands with Lady Tremorden, and afterwards with Lady Mabel and Simon Carne.  "I must congratulate you most heartily, Mr. Carne," he said, "on your victory today. You gave us an excellent race, and though I had the misfortune to be beaten by thirty seconds, still I have the satisfaction of knowing that the winner was a better boat in every way than my own."  "Your Majesty adds to the sweets of victory by your generous acceptance of defeat," Carne replied "But I must confess that I owe my success in no way to my own ability. The boat was chosen for me by another, and I have not even the satisfaction of saying that I sailed her myself."  "Nevertheless she is your property, and you will go down to posterity famous in yachting annals as the winner of the Queen’s Cup in this justly celebrated year."  With this compliment his Majesty turned to his hostess and entered into conversation with her, leaving his aidedecamp free to discuss the events of the day with Lady Mabel. When he took his departure halfanhour later, Carne also bade his friends goodbye, and, descending to his boat, was rowed away to his own beautiful steam yacht, which was anchored a few cables’ length away from the Imperial craft. He was to dine on board the latter vessel that evening.  On gaining the deck he was met by Belton, his valet, who carried a telegram in his hand. As soon as he received it, Carne opened it and glanced at the contents.  "Come below," he said quickly. "There is news enough here to give us something to think of for hours to come."  Reaching the saloon, which was decorated with all the daintiness of the upholsterer’s art, he led the way to the cabin he had arranged as a study. Having entered it, he shut and locked the door.  "It’s all up, Belton," he said. "The comedy has lasted long enough, and now it only remains for us to speak the tag, and after that to ring the curtain down as speedily as may be."  "I am afraid, sir, I do not quite take your meaning," said Belton. "Would you mind telling me what has happened?"  "I can do that in a very few words," the other answered. "This cablegram is from Trincomalee Liz, and was dispatched from Bombay yesterday. Read it for yourself."  He handed the paper to his servant, who read it carefully aloud:  To CARNE, Portchester House, Park Lane, London.Bradfield left fortnight since. Have ascertained that you are the object. TRINCOMALEE.  "This is very serious, sir," said the other, when he had finished.  "As you say, it is very serious indeed," Carne replied. "Bradfield thinks he has caught me at last, I suppose; but he seems to forget that it is possible for me to be as clever as himself. Let me look at the message again. Left a fortnight ago, did he? Then I’ve still a little respite. By Jove, if that’s the case, I’ll see that I make the most of it."  "But surely, sir, you will leave at once," said Belton quickly. "If this man, who has been after us so long, is now more than halfway to England, coming with the deliberate intention of running you to earth, surely, sir, you’ll see the advisability of making your escape while you have time."  Carne smiled indulgently.  "Of course I shall escape, my good Belton," he said. "You have never known me to neglect to take proper precautions yet; but before I go I must do one more piece of business. It must be something by the light of which all I have hitherto accomplished will look like nothing. Something really great, that will make England open its eyes as it has not done yet."  Belton stared at him, this time in undisguised amazement.  "Do you mean to tell me, sir," he said with the freedom of a privileged servant, "that you intend to run another risk, when the only man who knows sufficient of your career to bring you to book is certain to be in England in less than a fortnight? I cannot believe that you would be so foolish, sir. I beg of you to think what you are doing."  Carne, however, paid but small attention to his servant’s entreaties.  "The difficulty," he said to himself, speaking his thoughts aloud, "is to understand quite what to do. I seem to have used up all my big chances. However, I’ll think it over, and it will be strange if I don’t hit upon something. In the meantime, Belton, you had better see that preparations are made for leaving England on Friday next. Tell the skipper to have everything ready. We shall have done our work by that time; then hey for the open sea and freedom from the trammels of a society life once more. You might drop a hint or two to certain people that I am going, but be more than careful what you say. Write to the agents about Portchester House, and attend to all the other necessary details. You may leave me now."  Belton bowed, and left the cabin without another word. He knew his master sufficiently well to feel certain that neither entreaties nor expostulations would make him abandon the course he had mapped out for himself. That being so, he bowed to the inevitable with a grace which had now become a habit to him.  When he was alone, Carne once more sat for upwards of an hour in earnest thought. He then ordered his gig, and, when it was ready, set out for the shore. Making his way to the telegraph office, he dispatched a message which at any other and less busy, time, would have caused the operator some astonishment. It was addressed to a Mahommedan dealer in precious stones in Bombay, and contained only two words in addition to the signature. They were:  "Leaving?come."  He knew that they would reach the person for whom they were intended, and that she would understand their meaning and act accordingly.  The dinner that night on board the Imperial yacht _Hohenszrallas_ was a gorgeous affair in every sense of the word. All the principal yachtowners were present, and, at the conclusion of the banquet, Carne’s health as winner of the great event of the regatta, was proposed by the Emperor himself, and drunk amid enthusiastic applause. It was a proud moment for the individual in question, but he bore his honors with that quiet dignity that had stood him in such good stead on so many similar occasions. In his speech he referred to his approaching departure from England, and this, the first inkling of such news, came upon his audience like a thunderclap. When they had taken leave of his Majesty soon after midnight, and were standing on deck, waiting for their respective boats to draw up to the accommodation ladder, Lord Orpington made his way to where Simon Carne was standing.  "Is it really true that you intend leaving us so soon?" he asked.  "Quite true, unfortunately," Carne replied. "I had hoped to have remained longer, but circumstances over which I have no control make it imperative that I should return to India without delay. Business that exercises a vital influence upon my fortunes compels me. I am therefore obliged to leave without fail on Friday next. I have given orders to that effect this afternoon."  "I am extremely sorry to hear it, that’s all I can say," said Lord Amberley, who had just come up. "I assure you we shall all miss you very much indeed."  "You have all been extremely kind," said Carne, "and I have to thank you for an exceedingly pleasant time. But, there, let us postpone consideration of the matter for as long as possible. I think this is my boat. Won’t you let me take you as far as your own yacht?"  "Many thanks, but I don’t think we need trouble you," said Lord Orpington. "I see my gig is just behind yours."  "In that case, goodnight," said Carne. "I shall see you as arranged, tomorrow morning, I suppose?"  "At eleven," said Lord Amberley. "We’ll call for you and go ashore together. Goodnight."  By the time Carne had reached his yacht he had made up his mind. He had also hit upon a scheme, the daring of which almost frightened himself. If only he could bring it off, he told himself, it would be indeed a fitting climax to all he had accomplished since he had arrived in England. Retiring to his cabin, he allowed Belton to assist him in his preparations for the night almost without speaking. It was not until the other was about to leave the cabin that he broached the subject that was occupying his mind to the exclusion of all else.  "Belton," he said, "I have decided upon the greatest scheme that has come into my mind yet. If Simon Carne is going to say farewell to the English people on Friday next, and it succeeds, he will leave them a legacy to think about for some time after he has gone."  "You are surely not going to attempt anything further, sir," said Belton in alarm. "I did hope, sir, that you would have listened to my entreaties this afternoon."  "It was impossible for me to do so," said Carne. "I am afraid; Belton, you are a little lacking in ambition. I have noticed that on the last three occasions you have endeavored to dissuade me from my endeavors to promote the healthy excitement of the English reading public. On this occasion fortunately, I am able to withstand you. Tomorrow morning you will commence preparations for the biggest piece of work to which I have yet put my hand."  "If you have set your mind upon doing it, sir, I am quite aware that it is hopeless for me to say anything," said Belton resignedly. "May I know, however, what it is going to be?"  Carne paused for a moment before he replied.  "I happen to know that the Emperor of Westphalia, whose friendship I have the honor to claim," he said, "has a magnificent collection of gold plate on board his yacht. It is my intention, if possible, to become the possessor of it."  "Surely that will be impossible, sir," said Belton. "Clever as you undoubtedly are in arranging these things, I do not see how you can do it. A ship at the best of times is such a public place, and they will be certain to guard it very closely."  "I must confess that at first glance I do not quite see how it is to be managed, but I have a scheme in my head which I think may possibly enable me to effect my purpose. At any rate, I shall be able to tell you more about it tomorrow. First, let us try a little experiment."  As he spoke he seated himself at his dressingtable, and bade Belton bring him a box which had hitherto been standing in a corner. When he opened it, it proved to be a pretty little cedarwood affair divided into a number of small compartments, each of which contained crépe hair of a different color. Selecting a small portion from one, particular compartment, he unravelled it until he had obtained the length he wanted, and then with dexterous fingers constructed a moustache, which he attached with spirit gum to his upper lip. Two or three twirls gave it the necessary curl, then with a pair of ivorybacked brushes taken from the dressingtable he brushed his hair back in a peculiar manner, placed a hat of uncommon shape upon his head, took a heavy boat cloak from a cupboard near at hand, threw it round his shoulders, and, assuming an almost defiant expression, faced Belton, and desired him to tell him whom he resembled.  Familiar as he was with his master’s marvelous power of disguise and his extraordinary faculty of imitation, the latter could not refrain from expressing his astonishment.  "His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Westphalia," he said. "The likeness is perfect."  "Good," said Carne. "From that exhibition you will gather something of my plan. Tomorrow evening, as you are aware, I am invited to meet his Majesty, who is to dine ashore accompanied by his aidedecamp, Count Von Walzburg. Here is the latter’s photograph. He possesses, as you know, a very decided personality, which is all in our favor. Study it carefully."  So saying, he took from a drawer a photograph, which he propped against the lookingglass on the dressingtable before him. It represented a tall, militarylooking individual, with bristling eyebrows, a large nose, a heavy grey moustache, and hair of the same color. Belton examined it carefully.  "I can only suppose, sir," he said, "that as you are telling me this, you intend me to represent Count Von Walzburg."  "Exactly," said Carne. "That is my intention. It should not be at all difficult. The Count is just your height and build. You will only need the moustache, the eyebrows, the grey hair, and the large nose, to look the part exactly. Tomorrow will be a dark night, and, if only I can control circumstances sufficiently to obtain the chance I want, detection, in the first part of our scheme at any rate, should be more unlikely, if not almost impossible."  "You’ll excuse my saying so, I hope, sir," said Belton, "but it seems a very risky game to play when we have done so well up to the present."  "You must admit that the glory will be the greater, my friend, if we succeed."  "But surely, sir, as I said just now, they keep the plate you mention in a secure place, and have it properly guarded."  "I have made the fullest inquiries, you may be sure. It is kept in a safe in the chief steward’s cabin, and, while it is on board, a sentry is always on duty at the door. Yes, all things considered, I should say it is kept in a remarkably secure place."  "Then, sir, I’m still at a loss to see how you are going to obtain possession of it."  Carne smiled indulgently. It pleased him to see how perplexed his servant was.  "In the simplest manner possible," he said, "provided always that I can get on board the yacht without my identity being questioned. The manner in which we are to leave the vessel will be rather more dangerous, but not sufficiently so to cause us any great uneasiness. You are a good swimmer, I know, so that a hundred yards should not hurt you. You must also have a number of stout canvas sacks, say six prepared, and securely attached to each the same number of strong lines; the latter must be fifty fathoms long, and have at the end of each a stout swivelhook. The rest is only a matter of detail. Now, what have you arranged with regard to matters in town?"  "I have fulfilled your instructions, sir, to the letter," said Belton. "I have communicated with the agents who act for the owner of Portchester House. I have caused an advertisement to be inserted in all the papers tomorrow morning to the effect that the renowned detective Klimo, will be unable to meet his clients for at least a month, owing to the fact that he has accepted an important engagement upon the Continent, which will take him from home for that length of time. I have negotiated the sale of the various horses you have in training, and I have also arranged for the disposal of the animals and carriages you have now in use in London. Ram Gafur and the other native servants at Portchester House will come down by the midday train tomorrow, but before they do so, they will fulfill your instructions and repair the hole in the wall between the two houses. I cannot think of any more, sir."  "You have succeeded admirably, my dear Belton," said Carne, "and I am very pleased. Tomorrow you had better see that a paragraph is inserted in all the daily papers announcing the fact that it is my intention to leave England for India immediately, on important private business. I think that will do for tonight."  Next morning he was up by sunrise, and, by the time his friends Lords Orpington and Amberley were thinking about breakfast, had put the finishing touches to the scheme which was to bring his career in England to such a fitting termination.  According to the arrangement entered into on the previous day his friends called for him at eleven o’clock, when they went ashore together. It was a lovely morning, and Carne was in the highest spirits. They visited the Castle together, made some purchases in the town, and then went off to lunch on board Lord Orpington’s yacht. It was wellnigh three o’clock before Carne bade his host and hostess farewell, and descended the gangway in order to return to his own vessel. A brisk sea was running, and for this reason to step into the boat was an exceedingly difficult if not a dangerous, matter. Either he miscalculated his distance, or he must have jumped at the wrong moment; at any rate, he missed his footing, and fell heavily on to the bottom. Scarcely a second, however, had elapsed before his coxswain had sprung to his assistance, and lifted him up on to the seat in the stern. It was then discovered that he had been unfortunate enough to once more give a nasty twist to the ankle which had brought him to such grief when he had been staying at Greenthorpe Park on the occasion of the famous wedding.  "My dear fellow, I am so sorry," said Lord Orpington, who had witnessed the accident. "Won’t you come on board again? We can easily hoist you over the side."  "Many thanks," replied Carne, "but I think I can manage to get back to my own boat. It is better I should do so. My man has had experience of my little ailments, and knows exactly what is best to be done under such circumstances; but it is a terrible nuisance, all the same. I’m afraid it will be impossible for me now to be present at his Royal Highness’s dinner this evening, and I have been looking forward to it so much."  "We shall all be exceedingly sorry," said Lord Amberley. "I shall come across in the afternoon to see how you are."  "You are very kind," said Carne, "and I shall be immensely glad to see you if you can spare the time."  With that he gave the signal to his man to push off. By the time he reached his own yacht his foot was so painful that it was necessary for him to be lifted on boarda circumstance which was duly noticed by the occupants of all the surrounding yachts, who had brought their glasses to bear upon him. Once below in his saloon, he was placed in a comfortable chair and left to Belton’s careful attention.  "I trust you have not hurt yourself very much, sir," said that faithful individual, who, however, could not prevent a look of satisfaction coming into his face, which seemed to say that he was not illpleased that his master would, after all, be prevented from carrying out the hazardous scheme he had proposed to him the previous evening.  In reply Carne sprang to his feet without showing a trace of lameness.  "My dear Belton, how peculiarly dense you are today," he said, with a smile, as he noticed the other’s amazement. "Cannot you see that I have only been acting as you yourself wished I should do early this morningnamely, taking precautions? Surely you must see that, if I am laid up on board my yacht with a sprained ankle, Society will say that it is quite impossible for me to be doing any mischief elsewhere. Now, tell me, is everything prepared for tonight?"  "Everything, sir," Belton replied. "The dresses and wigs are ready. The canvas sacks, and the lines to which the spring hooks are attached, are in your cabin awaiting your inspection. As far as I can see, everything is prepared, and I hope will meet with your satisfaction."  "If you are as careful as usual I feel sure it will," said Carne. "Now get some bandages and make this foot of mine up into as artistic a bundle as you possibly can. After that help me on deck and prop me up in a chair. As soon as my accident gets known there will be certain to be shoals of callers on board, and I must play my part as carefully as possible."  Day closed in and found the sky covered with heavy clouds. Towards eight o’clock a violent storm of rain fell, and when Carne heard it beating upon the deck above his cabin, and reflected that in consequence the night would in all probability be dark, he felt his lucky star was indeed in the ascendant.  At halfpast eight he retired to his cabin with Belton, in order to prepare for the events of the evening. Never before had he paid such careful attention to his makeup. He knew that on this occasion the least carelessness might lead to detection, and he had no desire that his last and greatest exploit should prove his undoing.  It was halfpast nine before he and his servant had dressed and were ready to set off. Then placing broadbrimmed hats upon their heads, and carrying a portmanteau containing the cloaks and headgear which they were to wear later in the evening, they went on deck and descended into the dinghy which was waiting for them alongside. In something under a quarter of an hour they had been put ashore in a secluded spot, had changed their costumes, and were walking boldly down beside the water towards the steps where they could see the Imperial launch still waiting. Her crew were lolling about, joking and laughing, secure in the knowledge that it would be some hours at least before their sovereign would be likely to require their services again.  Their astonishment, therefore, may well be imagined when they saw approaching them the two men whom they had only halfanhour before brought ashore. Stepping in and taking his seat under the shelter, his Majesty ordered them to convey him back to the yacht with all speed. The accent and voice were perfect, and it never for an instant struck any one on board the boat that a deception was being practiced. Carne, however, was aware that this was only a preliminary; the most dangerous portion of the business was yet to come.  On reaching the yacht, he sprang out on the ladder, followed by his aidedecamp, Von Walzburg, and mounted the steps. His disguise must have been perfect indeed, for when he reached the deck he found himself face to face with the first lieutenant, who, on seeing him, saluted respectfully. For a moment Carne’s presence of mind almost deserted him; then, seeing that he was not discovered, he determined upon a bold piece of bluff. Returning the officer’s salute with just the air he had seen the Emperor use, he led him to suppose that he had important reasons for coming on board so soon, and, as if to back this assertion up, bade him send the chief steward to his cabin, and at the same time had the sentry removed from his door and placed at the end of the large saloon, with instructions to allow no one to pass until he was communicated with again.  The officer saluted and went off on his errand, while Carne, signing to Belton to follow him, made his way down the companion ladder to the Royal cabins. To both the next few minutes seemed like hours. Reaching the Imperial stateroom, they entered it, and closed the door behind. Provided the sentry obeyed his orders, which there was no reason to doubt he would do, and the Emperor himself did not return until they were safely off the vessel again, there seemed every probability of their being able to carry out their scheme without a hitch.  "Put those bags under the table, and unwind the lines and place them in the gallery outside the window. They won’t be seen there," said Carne to Belton, who was watching him from the doorway. "Then stand by, for in a few minutes the chief steward will be here. As soon as he enters you must manage to get between him and the door, and, while I am engaging him in conversation, spring on him, clutch him by the throat, and hold him until I can force this gag into his mouth. After that we shall be safe for some time at least, for not a soul will come this way until they discover their mistake. It seems to me we ought to thank our stars that the chief steward’s cabin was placed in such a convenient position. But hush, here comes the individual we want. Be ready to collar him as soon as I hold up my hand. If he makes a sound we are lost."  He had scarcely spoken before there was a knock at the door. When it opened, the chief steward entered the cabin, closing the door behind him.  "Schmidt," said his Majesty, who was standing at the further end of the cabin, "I have sent for you in order that I may question you on a matter of the utmost importance. Draw nearer."  The man came forward as he was ordered, and, having done so, looked his master full and fair in the face. Something he saw there seemed to stagger him. He glanced at him a second time, and was immediately confirmed in his belief.  "You are not the Emperor," he cried. "There is some treachery in this. I shall call for assistance."  He had half turned, and was about to give the alarm, when Carne held up his hand, and Belton, who had been creeping stealthily up behind him, threw himself upon him and had clutched him by the throat before he could utter a sound. The fictitious Emperor immediately produced a cleverly constructed gag and forced it into the terrified man’s mouth, who in another second was lying upon the floor bound hand and foot.  "There, my friend," said Carne quietly, as he rose to his feet a few moments later, "I don’t think you will give us any further trouble. Let me just see that those straps are tight enough, and then we’ll place you on this settee, and afterwards get to business with all possible dispatch."  Having satisfied himself on these points, he signed to Belton and between them they placed the man upon the couch.  "Let me see, I think, if I remember rightly, you carry the key of the safe in this pocket."  So saying, he turned the man’s pocket inside out and appropriated the bunch of keys he found therein. Choosing one from it, he gave a final look at the bonds which secured the prostrate figure, and then turned to Belton.  "I think he’ll do," he said. "Now for business. Bring the bags, and come with me."  So saying, he crossed the cabin, and, having assured himself that there was no one about to pry upon them, passed along the luxuriously carpeted alley way until he arrived at the door of the cabin assigned to the use of the chief steward, and in which was the safe containing the magnificent gold plate, the obtaining of which was the reason of his being there. To his surprise and chagrin, the door was closed and locked. In his plans he had omitted to allow for this emergency. In all probability, however, the key was in the man’s pocket, so, turning to Belton, he bade him return to the stateroom and bring him the keys he had thrown upon the table.  The latter did as he was ordered, and, when he had disappeared, Carne stood alone in the alley way waiting and listening to the various noises of the great vessel. On the deck overhead he could hear some one tramping heavily up and down, and then, in an interval of silence, the sound of pouring rain. Good reason as he had to be anxious, he could not help smiling as he thought of the incongruity of his position. He wondered what his aristocratic friends would say if he were captured and his story came to light. In his time he had impersonated a good many people, but never before had he had the honor of occupying such an exalted station. This was the last and most daring of all his adventures.  Minutes went by, and as Belton did not return, Carne found himself growing nervous. What could have become of him? He was in the act of going in search of him, when he appeared carrying in his hand the bunch of keys for which he had been sent. His master seized them eagerly.  "Why have you been so long?" he asked in a whisper. "I began to think something had gone wrong with you."  "I stayed to make our friend secure," the other answered. "He had wellnigh managed to get one of his hands free. Had he done so, he would have had the gag out of his mouth in no time, and have given the alarm. Then we should have been caught like rats in a trap."  "Are you quite sure he is secure now?" asked Carne anxiously.  "Quite," replied Belton, "I took good care of that."  "In that case we had better get to work on the safe without further delay. We have wasted too much time already, and every moment is an added danger."  Without more ado, Carne placed the most likely key in the lock and turned it. The bolt shot back, and the treasure chamber lay at his mercy.  The cabin was not a large one, but it was plain that every precaution had been taken to render it secure. The large safe which contained the Imperial plate, and which it was Carne’s intention to rifle, occupied one entire side. It was of the latest design, and when Carne saw it he had to confess to himself that, expert craftsman as he was, it was one that would have required all his time and skill to open.  With the master key, however, it was the work of only a few seconds. The key was turned, the lever depressed, and then, with a slight pull, the heavy door swung forward. This done, it was seen that the interior was full to overflowing.  "Come, Belton," he said, "get these things out as quickly as possible and lay them on the floor. We can carry only away a certain portion of the plunder, so let us make sure that that portion is the best."  A few moments later the entire cabin was strewn with salvers, goblets, bowls, epergnes, gold and silver dishes, plates, cups, knives, forks, and almost every example of the goldsmith’s art. In his choice Carne was not guided by what was handsomest or most delicate in workmanship or shape. Weight was his only standard. Silver he discarded altogether, for it was of less than no account. In something under ten minutes he had made his selection, and the stout canvas bags they had brought with them for that purpose were full to their utmost holding capacity.  "We can carry no more," said Carne to his faithful retainer, as they made the mouth of the last bag secure. "Pick up yours and let us get back to the Emperor’s stateroom."  Having locked the door of the cabin, they returned to the place whence they had started. There they found the unfortunate steward lying on the settee. Placing the bags he carried upon the ground, Carne crossed to him, and, before doing anything else, carefully examined the bonds with which he was secured. Having done this, he went to the stern windows, and, throwing one open, stepped into the gallery outside. Fortunately for what he intended to do, it was still raining heavily, and in consequence the night was as dark as the most consummate conspirator could have desired. Returning to the room, he bade Belton help him carry the bags into the gallery, and, when this had been done, made fast the swivelhooks to the rings in the mouth of each.  "Take up your bags as quietly as possible," he said, "and lower them one by one into the water, but take care that they don’t get entangled in the propeller. When you’ve done that, slip the rings at the other end of the lines through your belt, and buckle the latter tightly."  Belton did as he was ordered, and in a few moments the six bags were lying at the bottom of the sea.  "Now off with these wigs and things, and say when you’re ready for a swim."  Their disguises having been discarded and thrown overboard, Carne and Belton clambered over the rails of the gallery and lowered themselves until their feet touched the water. Next moment they had both let go, and were swimming in the direction of Carne’s own yacht.  Much exhausted, they reached the yacht’s stern and clutched at the rope ladder which Carne had himself placed there before he had set out on the evening’s excursion. In less time than it takes to tell, he had mounted it and gained the deck, followed by his faithful servant. They presented a sorry spectacle as they stood side by side at the taffrail, the water dripping from their clothes and pattering upon the deck.  "Thank goodness we are here at last," said Carne, as soon as he had recovered his breath sufficiently to speak. "Now slip off your belt, and hang it over this cleat with mine."  Belton did as he was directed, and then followed his master to the saloon companion ladder. Once below, they changed their clothes as quickly as possible, and having donned mackintoshes, returned to the deck, where it was still raining hard.  "Now," said Carne, "for the last and most important part of our evening’s work. Let us hope the lines will prove equal to the demands we are about to make upon them."  As he said this, he took one of the belts from his cleat upon which he had placed it, and having detached a line, began to pull it in, Belton following his example with another. Their hopes that they would prove equal to the confidence placed in them proved well founded, for, in something less than a quarter of an hour, the six bags, containing the Emperor of Westphalia’s magnificent gold plate, were lying upon the deck, ready to be carried below and stowed away in the secret place in which Carne had arranged to hide his treasure.  "Now, Belton," said Carne, as he pushed the panel back into its place, and pressed the secret spring that locked it, "I hope you’re satisfied with what we have done. We’ve made a splendid haul, and you shall have your share of it. In the meantime, just get me to bed as quickly as you can, for I’m dead tired. When you’ve done so, be off to your own. Tomorrow morning you will have to go up town to arrange with the bank authorities about my account."  Belton did as he was ordered and halfanhour later his master was safely in bed and asleep.  It was late next morning when he awoke. He had scarcely breakfasted before the Earl of Amberley and Lord Orpington made their appearance over the side. To carry out the part he had arranged to play, he received them seated in his deck chair, his swaddledup right foot reclining on a cushion before him. On seeing his guests, he made as if he would rise, but they begged him to remain seated.  "I hope your ankle is better this morning," said Lord Orpington politely, as he took a chair beside his friend.  "Much better, thank you," Carne replied. "It was not nearly so serious as I feared. I hope to be able to hobble about a little this afternoon. And now tell me the news, if there is any."  "Do you mean to say that you have not heard the great news?" asked Lord Amberley, in a tone of astonishment.  "I have heard nothing," Carne replied. "Remember, I have not been ashore this morning, and I have been so busily engaged with the preparations for my departure tomorrow that I have not had time to look at my papers. Pray what is this news of which you speak with such bated breath?"  "Listen, and I’ll tell you," Lord Orpington answered, and he related the events of the previous night, Carne’s face, in the meantime, showing great astonishment.  "Good gracious?" said Carne. "I never heard of such a thing. Surely it’s the most impudent robbery that has taken place for many years past. To represent the Emperor of Westphalia and his aidedecamp so closely that they could deceive even the officers of his own yacht, and to take a sentry off one post and place him in such a position as to protect them while at their own nefarious work, seems to me the very height of audacity. But how did they get their booty away again? Gold plate, under the most favorable circumstances, is by no means an easy thing to carry."  As he asked this question, Carne lit another cigar with a hand as steady as a rock.  "They must have escaped in a boat that, it is supposed, was lying under the shelter of the stern gallery," replied Lord Amberley.  "And is the chief steward able to furnish the police with no clue as to their identity?"  "None whatever," replied Orpington. "He opines to the belief, however, that they are Frenchmen. One of them, the man who impersonated the Emperor, seems to have uttered an exclamation in that tongue."  "And when was the robbery discovered?"  "Only when the real Emperor returned to the vessel shortly after midnight. There was no launch to meet him, and he had to get Tremorden to take him off. You can easily imagine the surprise his arrival occasioned. It was intensified when they went below to find his Majesty’s cabin turned upside down, the chief steward lying bound and gagged upon the sofa, and all that was most valuable of the gold plate missing."  "What an extraordinary story!"  "And now, having told you the news with which the place is ringing, we must be off about our business," said Orpington. "Is it quite certain that you are going to leave us tomorrow?"  "Quite, I am sorry to say," answered Carne. "I am going to ask as many of my friends as possible to do me the honor of lunching with me at one o’clock, and at five I shall weigh anchor and bid England goodbye. I shall have the pleasure of your company, I hope."  "I shall have much pleasure," said Orpington.  "And I also," replied Amberley.  "Then goodbye for the present. It’s just possible I may see you again during the afternoon."  The luncheon next day was as brilliant a social gathering as the most fastidious in such matters could have desired. Every one then in Cowes who had any claim to distinction was present, and several had undertaken the journey from town in order to say farewell to one who had made himself so popular during his brief stay in England. When Carne rose to reply to the toast of his health, proposed by the Prime Minister, it was observable that he was genuinely moved, as, indeed, were most of his hearers.  For the remainder of the afternoon his yacht’s deck was crowded with his friends, all of whom expressed the hope that it might not be very long before he was amongst them once more.  To these kind speeches Carne invariably offered a smiling reply.  "I also trust it will not be long," he answered. "I have enjoyed my visit immensely, and you may be sure I shall never forget it as long as I live."  An hour later the anchor was weighed, and his yacht was steaming out of the harbor amid the scene of intense enthusiasm. As the Prime Minister had that afternoon informed him, in the public interest, the excitement of his departure was dividing the honors of the burglary of the Emperor of Westphalia’s gold plate.  Carne stood beside his captain on the bridge, watching the little fleet of yachts until his eyes could no longer distinguish them. Then he turned to Belton, who had just joined him, and, placing his hand upon his shoulder, said:  "So much for our life in England, Belton, my friend. It has been glorious fun, and no one can deny that from a business point of view it
