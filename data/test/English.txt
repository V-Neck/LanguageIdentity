tain blind beggar who put in an appearance there towards sunset on the Thursday preceding the Derby of 18, and you will do so. When that mysterious individual first came in sight he was creeping along the dusty high road that winds across the Downs from Market Stopford to Beaton Junction, dolorously quavering a ballad that was intended to be, though few would have recognized it, "The Wearing of the Green."  On reaching the stables he tapped along the wall with his stick, until he came to the gate. Then, when he was asked his business by the head lad, who had been called up by one of the stable boys he stated that he was starving, and, with peculiar arts of his own induced them to provide him with a meal. For upwards of an hour he remained talking with the lads, and then wended his way down the hill towards the village, where he further managed to induce the rector to permit him to occupy one of his outhouses for the night.  After tea he went out and sat on the green, but towards eight o’clock he crossed the stream at the ford, and made his way up to a little copse, which ornamented a slight eminence, on the opposite side of the village to that upon which the training stables were situated.  How he found his way, considering his infirmity, it is difficult to say, but that he did find it was proved by his presence there. It might also have been noticed that when he was once under cover of the bushes he gave up tapping the earth with his stick, and walked straight enough, and without apparent hesitation, to the stump of a tree upon which he seated himself.  For some time he enjoyed the beauty of the evening undisturbed by the presence of any other human being. Then he heard a step behind him and next moment a smartlooking stable lad parted the bushes and came into view.  "Hullo," said the newcomer. "So you managed to get here first?"  "So I have," said the old rascal, "and it’s wonderful when you come to think of it, considering my age and what a poor old blind chap I be. But I’m glad to find ye’ve managed to get away, my lad. Now what have ye got to say for yourself?"  "I don’t know that I’ve got anything to say," replied the boy. "But this much is certain, what you want can’t be done."  "And a fine young cockerel you are to be sure, to crow so loud that it can’t be done," said the old fellow, with an evil chuckle. "How do you know it can’t?"  "Because I don’t see my way," replied the other. "It’s too dangerous by a long sight. Why, if the guv’nor was to get wind of what you want me to do, England itself wouldn’t be big enough to hold us both. You don’t know ’im as well as I do."  "I know him well enough for all practical purposes," replied the beggar. "Now, if you’ve got any more objections to raise, be quick about it. If you haven’t, then I’ll talk to you. You haven’t? Very good then. Now, just hold your jaw, open your ears, and listen to what I’ve got to say. What time do you go to exercise tomorrow morning?"  "Nine o’clock."  "Very good then. You go down on to the Downs, and the boss sends you off with Vulcanite for a canter. What do you do? Why, you go steadily enough as long as he can see you, but directly you’re round on the other side of the hill you stick in your heels, and nip into the wood that runs along on your right hand, just as if your horse was bolting with you. Once in there, you go through for a halfamile until you come to the stream, ford that, and then cut into the next wood, riding as if the devil himself were after you, until you reach the path above Hangman’s Hollow. Do you know the place?"  "I reckon I ought to."  "Well, then, you just make tracks for it. When you get there you’ll find me waiting for you. After that I’ll take over command, and get both you and the horse out of England in such a way that nobody will ever suspect. Then there’ll be five hundred pounds for your trouble, a safe passage with the horse to South America, and another five hundred the day the nag is set ashore. There’s not as much risk as you could take between your finger and thumb, and a lad with a spirit like yours could make a fortune with a thousand pounds on the other side. What have you to say now?"  "It’s all very well," replied the lad, "but how am I to know that you’ll play straight with me?"  "What do you take me for?" said the beggar indignantly, at the same time putting his hand in his coat pocket and producing what looked like a crumpled piece of paper. "If you doubt me, there’s something that may help to convince you. But don’t go showing it around tonight, or you’ll be giving yourself away, and that’ll mean the Stone Jug for you, and ’Amen’ to all your hopes of a fortune. You’ll do as I wish now, I suppose?"  "I’ll do it," said the lad sullenly, as he crumpled the banknote up and put it in his pocket. "But now I must be off. Since there’s been this fuss about Knight of Malta, the guv’nor has us all in before eight o’clock, and keeps the horse under lock and key, with the head lad sleeping in the box with him."  "Well, goodnight to you, and don’t you forget about tomorrow morning; niggle the horse about a bit just to make him impatient like, and drop a hint that he’s a bit fresh. That will make his bolting look more feasible. Don’t leave the track while there’s any one near you, but, as soon as you do, ride like thunder to the place I told you of. I’ll see that they’re put off the scent as to the way you’ve gone."  "All right," said the lad. "I don’t like it, but I suppose I’m in too deep now to draw back. Goodnight."  "Goodnight, and good luck to you."  Once he had got rid of the youth, Carne (for it was he) returned by another route to the rector’s outbuilding, where he laid himself down on the straw, and was soon fast asleep. His slumbers lasted till nearly daybreak, when he rose and made his way across country to the small copse above Hangman’s Hollow on the road from Exbridge to Beaton Junction. Here he discovered a large van drawn up apparently laden with furniture both inside and out. The horses were feeding beneath a tree, and a couple of men were eating their breakfast beside them. On seeing Carne, the taller of the paira respectablelooking workman, with a big brown beardrose and touched his hat. The other looked with astonishment at the disreputable beggar standing before them.  "So you arrived here safely," said Carne. "If anything you’re a little before your time. Boil a cup of tea, and give me something to eat as quickly as possible, for I am nearly famished. When you have done that, get out the clothes I told you to bring with you, and let me change into them. It wouldn’t do for any of the people from the village back yonder to be able to say afterwards that they saw me talking with you in this rigout."  As soon as his hunger was appeased he disappeared into the wood, and dressed himself in his new attire. Another suit of clothes, and an apron such as might be worn by a furniture remover’s foreman, a grey wig, a short grey beard and moustache, and a bowler hat, changed his identity completely; indeed, when his rags had been hidden in the hollow of a tree it would have been a difficult matter to have traced any resemblance between the respectablelooking workman eating his breakfast and the disreputable beggar of halfanhour before.  It was close upon nine o’clock by this time, and as soon as he realized this Carne gave the order to put the horses to. This done, they turned their attention to the back of the van, and then a strange thing became apparent. Though to all appearances, viewed from the open doors at the end, the inside of this giant receptacle was filled to its utmost capacity with chests of drawers, chairs, bedsteads, carpets, and other articles of household furniture, yet by pulling a pair of handles it was possible for two men easily to withdraw what looked like half the contents of the van.  The poorest observer would then have noticed that in almost every particular these articles were dummies, affixed to a screen, capable of being removed at a moment’s notice. The remainder of the van was fitted after the fashion of a stable, with a manger at the end and a pair of slings dependent from the roof.  The nervous tension produced by the waiting soon became almost more than the men could bear. Minute after minute went slowly by, and still the eagerly expected horse did not put in an appearance. Then Belton, whom Carne had placed on the lookout, came flying towards them with the report that he could hear a sound of galloping hoofs in the wood. A few seconds later the noise could be plainly heard at the van, and almost before they had time to comment upon it, a magnificent thoroughbred, ridden by the stable boy who had talked to the blind beggar on the previous evening, dashed into view, and pulled up beside the van.  "Jump off," cried Carne, catching at the horse’s head, "and remove the saddle. Now be quick with those cloths; we must rub him down or he’ll catch cold."  When the horse was comparatively dry he was led into the van which was to be his stable for the next few hours, and, in spite of his protests, slung in such a fashion that his feet did not touch the floor. This business completed, Carne bade the frightened boy get in with him, and take care that he did not, on any account, neigh.  After that the mask of furniture was replaced, and the doors closed and locked. The men mounted to their places on the box and roof, and the van continued its journey along the highway towards the Junction. But satisfactory as their attempt had so far proved, the danger was by no means over. Scarcely had they proceeded three miles on their way before Carne distinguished the sound of hoofs upon the road behind him. A moment later a young man, mounted on a wellbred horse, came into view, rode up alongside, and signalled to the driver to stop.  "What’s the matter?" inquired the latter, as he brought his horses to a standstill. "Have we dropped anything?"  "Have you seen anything of a boy on a horse?" asked the man, who was so much out of breath that he could scarcely get his words out.  "What sort of a boy, and what sort of a horse?" asked the man on the van.  "A youngish boy," was the reply, "seven stone weight, with sandy hair, on a thoroughbred."  "No; we ain’t seen no boy with sandy ’air, ridin’ of a thoroughbred ’orse seven stone weight," said Carne. "What’s ’e been an’ done?"  "The horse has bolted with him off the Downs, back yonder," answered the man. "The guv’nor has sent us out in all directions to look for him."  "Sorry we can’t oblige you," said the driver as he prepared to start his team again. "Goodday to you."  "Much obliged," said the horseman, and, when he had turned off into a side road, the van continued its journey till it reached the railway station. A quarter of an hour later it caught the eleven o’clock goods train and set off for the small seaside town of Barworth, on the south coast, where it was shipped on board a steamer which had arrived that morning from London.  Once it was safely transferred from the railway truck to the deck, Carne was accosted by a tall, swarthy individual, who, from his importance, seemed to be both the owner and the skipper of the vessel. They went down into the saloon together, and a few moments later an observer, had one been there, might have seen a cheque for a considerable sum of money change hands.  An hour later the _Jessie Branker_ was steaming out to sea, and a militarylooking individual, not at all to be compared with the industrious mechanic who had shipped the furniture van on board the vessel bound for Spain, stood on the platform of the station waiting for the express train to London. On reaching the metropolis he discovered it surging beneath the weight of a great excitement. The streets reechoed with the raucous cries of the newsvenders:  "The Derby favorite stolenVulcanite missing from his stable!"  Next morning an advertisement appeared in every paper of consequence, offering "A reward of Five Hundred Pounds for any information that might lead to the conviction of the person or persons who on the morning of May 28th had stolen, or caused to be stolen, from the Pitman Training Stables, the Derby favorite, Vulcanite, the property of the Right Honorable the Earl of Calingforth."  The week following, Knight of Malta, owned by Simon Carne, Esq., of Dorchester House, Park Lane, won the Derby by a neck in a scene of intense excitement, the Mandarin being second, and The Filibuster third. It is a strange fact that to this day not a member of the racing world has been able to solve the mystery surrounding the disappearance of one of the greatest horses that ever set foot on an English racecourse.  Today, if Simon Carne thinks of that momentous occasion when, amid the shouting crowd of Epsom, he led his horse back a winner, he smiles softly to himself and murmurs beneath his breath:  "Valued at twenty thousand pounds, and beaten in the Derby by a furniture van."      *CHAPTER V.*   *A SERVICE TO THE STATE.*   It was the day following that upon which Simon Carne, presented by the Earl of Amberley, had made his bow before the Heir Apparent at the second levee of the season, that Klimo entered upon one of the most interesting cases which had so far come into his experience. The clock in his consultingroom had just struck one when his elderly housekeeper entered and handed him a card, bearing the name of Mrs. George Jeffreys, 14 Bellamer Street, Bloomsbury. The detective immediately bade his servant admit the visitor, and, almost before he had given the order, the lady in question stood before him.  She was young not more than twentyfour at most, a frail wisp of a girl, with light brown hair and eyes that spoke for her nationality as plain as any words. She was neatly but by no means expensively dressed, and showed evident signs of being oppressed by a weight of trouble. Klimo looked at her, and in that glance took in everything. In spite of the fact that he was reputed to possess a heart as hard as any flint, it was noticeable that his voice, when he spoke to her was not as gruff as that in which he usually addressed his visitors.  "Pray sit down," he said, "and tell me in as few words as possible what it is you desire that I should do for you. Speak as clearly as you can, and, it you want my help, don’t hesitate to tell me everything."  The girl sat down as ordered, and immediately commenced her tale.  "My name is Eileen Jeffreys," she said. "I am the wife of an English Bank Inspector, and the daughter of Septimus O’Grady, of Chicago, U.S.A."  "I shall remember," replied Klimo. "And how long have you been married?"  "Two years," answered the girl. "Two years next September. My husband and I met in America, and then came to England to settle."  "In saying goodbye to your old home, you left your father behind, I presume?"  "Yes, he preferred to remain in America."  "May I ask his profession?"  "That, I’m afraid, foolish as it may seem to say so, I cannot tell you," answered the girl, with a slightly heightened color. "His means of earning a living were always kept a secret from me."  "That was rather strange; was it not?" said Klimo. "Had he private resources?"  "None that I ever heard of," replied the girl.  "Did no business men ever come to see him?"  "But very few people came to us at all. We had scarcely any friends."  "Of what nationality were the friends who did come?"  "Mostly Irish, like ourselves," answered Mrs. Jeffreys.  "Was there ever any quarrel between your father and your husband, prior to your leaving America?"  "Never any downright quarrel," said the girl. "But I am sorry to say they were not always the best of friends. In those days my father was a very difficult man to get on with."  "Indeed?" said Klimo. "Now, perhaps you had better proceed with your story."  "To do that, I must explain that at the end of January of this present year, my father, who was then in Chicago, sent us a cablegram to say he was leaving for England that very day, and that, upon his arrival in England, if we had no objection, he would like to take up his residence with us. He was to sail from New York on the Saturday following, and, as you know, the passage takes six days or thereabouts. Arriving in England he came to London and put up at our house in Bellamer Street, Bloomsbury. That was during the first week in February last, and off and on he has been living with us ever since."  "Have you any idea what brought him to England?"  "Not the least," she answered deliberately, after a few seconds’ pause, which Klimo did not fail to notice.  "Did he do business with any one that you are aware of?"  "I cannot say. On several occasions he went away for a week at a time into the Midlands, but what took him there I have no possible idea. On the last occasion he left us on the fifteenth of last month, and returned on the ninth of this, the same day that my husband was called away to Marseilles on important banking business. It was easy to see that he was not well. He was feverish, and within a short time of my getting him to bed he began to wander in his mind, declaring over and over again that he bitterly repented some action he had taken, and that if he could once consider himself safe again would be quit of the whole thing forever.  "For close upon a fortnight I continued to nurse him, until he was so far recovered as to recognize me once more. The day that he did so I took in at the door this cablegram, from which I may perhaps date the business that has brought me to you."  She took a paper from her pocket and handed it to Klimo, who glanced at it, examined the postmark and the date, and then placed it upon the desk before him It was from Chicago, and ran as follows:   O’Grady, 14 Bellamer Street, London, England.  Why no answer? Reply chances of doing business.  NERO.   "Of course, it was impossible for me to tell what this meant. I was not in my father’s confidence, and I had no notion who his mysterious correspondent might be. But as the doctor had distinctly stated that to allow him to consider any business at all would bring on a relapse and probably kill him, I placed the message in a drawer, and determined to let it remain there until he should be well enough to attend to it without danger to himself. The week following he was not quite so well, and fortunately there was complete silence on the part of his correspondents. Then this second message arrived. As you will see it is also from Chicago and from the same person.   Reply immediately, or remember consequences. Time presses, if do not realize at present price, market will be lost. NERO.   "Following my previous line of action, I placed this communication also in the drawer, and determined to let Nero wait for a reply. By doing so, however, I was incurring greater trouble than I dreamt of. Within fortyeight hours I received the following message, and upon that I made up my mind and came off at once to you. What it means I do not know, but that it bodes some ill to my father I feel certain. I had heard of your fame, and as my husband is away from home, my father unable to protect himself, and I am without friends at all in England, I thought the wisest course I could pursue would be to consult you."  "Let me look at the last cablegram," said Klimo, putting his hand from the box, and taking the slip of paper.  The first and second message were simplicity itself; this, however, was a complete enigma. It was worded as follows:   UneasyAlphaOmegaNineteenTwelvetodayfive lacsarrangeseventyeightBrazilsonetwentynine.  NERO.   Klimo read it through, and the girl noticed that he shook his head over it.  "My dear young lady," he said, "I am afraid that it would be safer for you not to tell me any further, for I fear it is not in my power to help you."  "You will not help me now that I have told you my miserable position? Then there is nothing before me but despair. Oh, sir, is your decision quite irrevocable? You cannot think how I have counted on your assistance."  "I regret exceedingly that I am compelled to disappoint you," he answered. "But my time is more than occupied as it is, and I could not give your case my attention, even if I would."  His decision had been too much for her fortitude, and before he could prevent it, her head was down upon her hands and she had begun to weep bitterly. He attempted to comfort her, but in vain; and when she left him, tears were still coursing down her cheeks. It was not until she had been gone about ten minutes, and he had informed his housekeeper that he would see no more clients that day, that he discovered that she had left her precious cablegrams behind her.  Actuated by a feeling of curiosity, he sat down again and spread the three cablegrams out upon his writingtable. The first two, as I have said, required no consideration, they spoke for themselves, but the third baffled him completely. Who was this Septimus O’Grady who lived in Chicago, and whose associates spent their time discussing the wrongs of Ireland? How was it that, being a man innocent of private means, he engaged in no business?  Then another question called for consideration. If he had no business, what brought him to London and took him so repeatedly into the Midlands? These riddles he set aside for the present and began to pick the last cablegram to pieces. That its author was not easy in his mind when he wrote it was quite certain.  Then who and what were the Alpha and Omega mentioned? What connection had they with Nero; also what did nineteen and twelve mean when coupled with Today? Further, why should five lacs arrange seventyeight Brazils? And what possible sense could be made out of the numbers onetwentyand nine? He read the message from beginning to end again, after that from the end to the beginning, and, like a good many other men in a similar position, because he could not understand it, found himself taking a greater interest in it. This feeling had not left him when he had put off disguise as Klimo and was Simon Carne once more.  While he was eating his lunch the thought of the lonely Irishman lying ill in a house, where he was without doubt an unwelcome guest, fascinated him strangely, and when he rose from the table he found he was not able to shake off the impression it had given him. That the girl had some notion of her father’s business he felt as certain as of his own name, even though she had so strenuously denied the fact. Otherwise why should she have been so frightened by what might have been simply innocent business messages in cypher? That she was frightened was as plain as the sun then shining into his room. Despite the fact that he had resolved not to take up the case, he went into his study, and took the cablegrams from the drawer in which he had placed them. Then drawing a sheet of paper towards him, he set to work upon the puzzle.  "The first word requires no explanation," he said as he wrote it down. "For the two next, Alpha and Omega, we will, for the sake of argument, write The Beginning and The End, and as that tells us nothing, we will substitute for them The First and The Last. Now, who or what are The First and The Last? Are they the first and last words of a code, or of a word, or do they refer to two individuals who are the principal folk in some company or conspiracy? If the latter, it is just possible they are the people who are so desperately uneasy. The next two words, however, are too much for me altogether."  Uninteresting as the case appeared at first sight, he soon discovered that he could think of nothing else. He found himself puzzling over it during an afternoon concert at the Queen’s Hall, and he even thought of it while calling upon the wife of the Prime Minister afterwards. As he drove in the Park before dinner, the wheels of his carriage seemed to be saying "Alpha and Omega, nineteen, twelve" over and over again with pitiless reiteration, and by the time he reached home once more he would gladly have paid a tenpound note for a feasible solution of the enigma, if only to get its weight off his mind.  While waiting for dinner he took pen and paper and wrote the message out again, this time in halfadozen different ways. But the effect was the same, none of them afforded him any clue. He then took the second letter of each word, after that the third, then the fourth, and so on until he had exhausted them. The result in each case was absolute gibberish, and he felt that he was no nearer understanding it than when Mrs. Jeffrey’s had handed it to him nearly eight hours before.  During the night he dreamt about it, and when he woke in the morning its weight was still upon his mind. "Nineteentwelve," it is true, had left him, but he was not better off for the reason that "Seventyeight Brazils" had taken its place. When he got out of bed he tried it again. But at the end of halfanhour his patience was exhausted.  "Confound the thing," he said, as he threw the paper from him, and seated himself in a chair before his lookingglass in order that his confidential valet, Belton, might shave him. "I’ll think no more of it. Mrs. Jeffreys must solve the mystery for herself. It has worried me too much already."  He laid his head back upon the rest and allowed his valet to run the soap brush over his chin. But, however much he might desire it, his Old Man of the Sea was not to be discarded so easily; the word "Brazils" seemed to be painted in letters of fire upon the ceiling. As the razor glided over his cheek he thought of the various constructions to be placed upon the wordthe CountryStocksand even nutsBrazil nuts, Spanish nuts, Barcelona nuts, walnuts, cob nutsand then, as if to make the nightmare more complete, no less a thing than Nutall’s Dictionary. The smile the last suggestion caused him came within an ace of leaving its mark upon his cheek. He signed to the man to stay his hand.  "Egad!" he cried, "who knows but this may be the solution of the mystery? Go down to the study, Belton, and bring me Nuttall’s Dictionary."  He waited with one side of his face still soaped until his value returned, bringing with him the desired volume. Having received it he placed it upon the table and took up the telegram.  "Seventyeight Brazils," it said, "onetwentynine."  Accordingly he chose the seventieth page, and ran his fingers down the first column. The letter was B, but the eighth word proved useless. He thereupon turned to the seventyeighth page, and in the first column discovered the word _Bomb_. In a second the whole aspect of the case changed, and he became all eagerness and excitement. The last words on ’the telegram were "onetwentynine," yet it was plain that there were barely a hundred upon the page. The only explanation, therefore, was that the word "One" distinguished the column, and the "twentynine" referred to the number of the word in it.  Almost trembling with eagerness he began to count. Surely enough the twentyninth word was Bomb. The coincidence was, to say the least of it, extraordinary. But presuming that it was correct, the rest of the message was simplicity itself. He turned the telegram over, and upon the back transcribed the communication as he imagined it should be read. When he had finished, it ran as follows:  Owing to O’Grady’s silence, the Society in Chicago is growing uneasy. Two men, who are the first and last, or, in other words, the principal members, are going to do something (Nineteentwelve) today with fifty thousand somethings, so arrange about the bombs.  Having got so far, all that remained to be done was to find out to what "nineteentwelve" referred. He turned to the dictionary again, and looked for the twelfth word upon the nineteenth page. This proved to be "Alkahest," which told him nothing. So he reversed the proceedings and looked for the nineteenth word upon the twelfth page; but this proved even less satisfactory than before. However much the dictionary might have helped him hitherto, it was plainly useless now. He thought and thought, but without success. He turned up the almanac, but the dates did not fit in.  He then wrote the letters of the alphabet upon a sheet of paper, and against each placed its equivalent number. The nineteenth letter was S, the twelfth L. Did they represent two words, or were they the first and the last letters of a word? In that case, what could it be. The only three he could think of were _soil_, _sell_ and _sail_. The two first were hopeless, but the last seemed better. But how would that fit in? He took up his pen and tried it.   Owing to O’Grady’s silence, the Society in Chicago is growing uneasy. Two men, who are the first and last, or, in other words, the principal members, sail today with fifty thousand somethings, probably pounds or dollars, so prepare bombs.  NERO.   He felt convinced that he had hit it at last. Either it was a very extraordinary coincidence, or he had discovered the answer to the riddle. If this solution were correct, one thing was certain, he had got in his hands, quite by chance, a clue to one of the biggest Fenian conspiracies ever yet brought to light. He remembered that at that moment London contained half the crowned heads, or their representatives, of Europe. What better occasion could the enemies of law and order desire for striking a blow at the Government and society in general? What was he to do?  To communicate with the police and thus allow himself to be drawn into the affair, would be an act of the maddest folly; should he therefore drop the whole thing, as he had at first proposed, or should he take the matter into his own hands, help Mrs. Jeffreys in her trouble by shipping her father out of harm’s way, outwit the Fenians, and appropriate the fifty thousand pounds mentioned in the cablegram himself?  The last idea was distinctly a good one. But, before it could be done, he felt he must be certain of his facts. Was the fifty thousand referred to money or was it something else? If the former, was it pounds or was it dollars? There was a vast difference, but in either case, if only he could hit on a safe scheme, he would be well repaid for whatever risk he might run. He decided to see Mrs. Jeffreys without loss of time. Accordingly, after breakfast, he sent her a note asking her to call upon him, without fail, at twelve o’clock.  Punctuality is not generally considered a virtue possessed by the sex of which Mrs. Jeffreys was so unfortunate a member, but the clock upon Klimo’s mantelpiece had scarcely struck the hour before she put in an appearance. He immediately bade her be seated.  "Mrs. Jeffreys," he began with a severely judicial air, "it is with much regret I find that while seeking my advice yesterday you were all the time deceiving me. How was it that you failed to tell me that your father was connected with a Fenian Society whose one aim and object is to destroy law and order in this country."  The question evidently took the girl by surprise. She became deathly pale, and for a moment Klimo thought she was going to faint. With a marvelous exhibition of will, however, she pulled herself together and faced her accuser.  "You have no right to say such a thing," she began. "My father is."  "Pardon me," he answered quietly, "but I am in the possession of information which enables me to understand exactly _what_ he is. If you answer me correctly it is probable that after all I will take your case up, and will help you to save your father’s life, but if you decline to do so, ill as he is, he will be arrested within twentyfour hours, and then nothing on earth can save him from condign punishment. Which do you prefer?"  "I will tell you everything," she said quickly. "I ought to have done so at first, but you can understand why I shrank from it. My father has for a long time past been ashamed of the part he has been playing, but he could not help himself. He was too valuable to them, and they would not let him slip. They drove him on and on, and it was his remorse and anxiety that broke him down at last."  "I think you have chosen the better course in telling me this. I will ask my questions, and you can answer them. To begin with, where are the headquarters of the Society?"  "In Chicago."  "I thought as much. And is it possible for you to tell me the names of the two principal members?"  "There are many members, and I don’t know that one is greater than another."  "But there must be some who are more important than others. For instance, the pair referred to in this telegram as Alpha and Omega?"  "I can only think," she answered, after a moment’s thought, "that they must be the two men who came oftenest to our house, Messrs. Maguire and Rooney."  "Can you describe them, or, better still, have you their photographs?"  "I have a photograph of Mr. Rooney. It was taken last year."  "You must send it to me as soon as you get home," he said; "and now give me as close a description as possible of the other person to whom you refer, Mr. Maguire."  Mrs. Jeffreys considered for a few moments before she answered.  "He is tall, standing fully six feet, I should think," she said at last, "with red hair and watery blue eyes, in the left of which there is a slight cast. He is broadshouldered and, in spite of his long residence in America, speaks with a decided brogue. I know them for desperate men, and if they come over to England may God help us all. Mr. Klimo, you don’t think the police will take my father?"  "Not if you implicitly obey my instructions," he answered.  Klimo thought for a few seconds, and then continued: "If you wish me to undertake this business, which I need hardly tell you is out of my usual line, you will now go home and send me the photograph you spoke of a few moments since. After that you will take no sort of action until you hear from me again. For certain reasons of my own I shall take this matter up, and will do my utmost to save your father. One word of advice first, say nothing to anybody, but pack your father’s boxes and be prepared to get him out of England, if necessary, at a moment’s notice."  The girl rose and made as if she would leave the room, but instead of doing so she stood irresolute. For a few moments she said nothing, but fumbled with the handle of her parasol and breathed heavily. Then the pluck which had so far sustained her gave way entirely, and she fell back on her chair crying as if her heart would break. Klimo instantly left his box and went round to her. He made a figure queer enough to please any one, in his oldfashioned clothes, his skullcap, his long grey hair reaching almost to his shoulders, and with his smoked glass spectacles perched upon his nose.  "Why cry, my dear young lady?" said Klimo. "Have I not promised to do my best for you? Let us, however, understand each other thoroughly. If there is anything you are keeping back you must tell me. By not speaking out you are imperilling your own and your father’s safety."  "I know that you must think that I am endeavoring to deceive you," she said; "but I am so terribly afraid of committing myself that I hardly know what to tell and what not to tell. I have come to you, having no friends in the whole world save my husband, who is in Marseilles, and my father, who, as I have said, is lying dangerously ill in our house.  "Of course I know what my father has been. Surely you cannot suppose that a grownup girl like myself could be so dense as not to guess why few save Irishmen visited our house, and why at times there were men staying with us for weeks at a time, who lived in the back rooms and never went outside our front door, and who, when they did take their departure, sneaked out in the dead of night.  "I remember a time in the fall of the last year that I was at home, when there were more meetings than ever, and when these men, Maguire and Rooney, almost lived with us. They and my father were occupied day and night in a room at the top of the house, and then, in the January following, Maguire came to England. Three weeks later the papers were full of a terrible dynamite explosion in London, in which forty innocent people lost their lives. Mr. Klimo, you must imagine for yourself the terror and shame that seized me, particularly when I remembered that my father was a companion of the men who had been concerned in it.  "Now my father repents, and they are edging him on to some fresh outrage. I cannot tell you what it is, but I know this, that if Maguire and Rooney are coming to England, something awful is about to happen, and if they distrust him, and there is any chance of any one getting into trouble, my father will be made the scapegoat.  "To run away from them would be to court certain death. They have agents in almost every European city, and, unless we could get right away to the other side of the world, they would be certain to catch us. Besides my father is too ill to travel. The doctors say he must not be disturbed under any pretence whatever."  "Well, well!" said Klimo, "leave the matter to me, and I will see what can be done. Send me the photograph you spoke of, and let me know instantly if there are any further developments."  "Do you mean that after all I can rely upon you helping me?"  "If you are brave," he answered, "not without. Now, one last question, and then you must be off. I see in the last telegram, mention made of fifty lacs; I presume that means money?"  "A lac is their term for a thousand pounds," she answered without hesitation.  "That will do," said Klimo. "Now go home and don’t worry yourself more than you can help. Above all, don’t let any one suspect that I have any interest in the case. Upon your doing that will in a great measure depend your safety."  She promised to obey him in this particular as in the others, and then took her departure.  When Klimo had passed into the adjoining house, he bade his valet accompany him to his study.  "Belton," he said, as he seated himself in a comfortable chair before his writingtable, "I have this morning agreed to undertake what promises to be one of the most dangerous, and at the same time most interesting, cases that has yet come under my notice. A young lady, the wife of a respectable Bank Inspector, has been twice to see me lately with a very sad story. Her father, it would appear, is an Irish American, with the usual prejudice against this country. He has been for some time a member of a Fenian Society, possibly one of their most active workers. In January last the executive sent him to his country to arrange for an exhibition of their powers.  "Since arriving here the father has been seized with remorse, and the mental strain and fear thus entailed have made him seriously ill. For weeks he has been lying at death’s door in his daughter’s house. Hearing nothing from him the Society has telegraphed again and again, but without result. In consequence, two of the chief and most dangerous members are coming over here with fifty thousand pounds at their disposal, to look after their erring brother, to take over the management of affairs, and to commence the slaughter as per arrangement.  "Now as a peaceable citizen of the City of London, and a humble servant of Her Majesty the Queen, it is manifestly my duty to deliver these rascals into the hands of the police. But to do that would be to implicate the girl’s father, and to kill her husband’s faith in her family; for it must be remembered he knows nothing of the father’s Fenian tendencies. It would also mix me up in a most undesirable matter at a time when I have the best reasons for desiring to keep quiet.  "Well, the long and the short of the matter is that I have been thinking the question out, and I have arrived at the following conclusion. If I can hit upon a workable scheme I shall play policeman and public benefactor, checkmate the dynamiters, save the girl and her father, and reimburse myself to the extent of fifty thousand pounds. Fifty thousand pounds, Belton, think of that. If it hadn’t been for the money I should have had nothing at all to do with it."  "But how will you do it, sir?" asked Belton, who had learnt by experience never to be surprised at anything his master might say or do.  "Well, so far," he answered, "it seems a comparatively easy matter. I see that the last telegram was dispatched on Saturday, May 26th, and says, or purports to say, ’sail today.’ In that case, all being well, they should be in Liverpool some time tomorrow, Thursday. So we have a clear day at our disposal in which to prepare a reception for them. Tonight I am to have a photograph of one of the men in my possession, and tomorrow I shall send you to Liverpool to meet them. Once you have set eyes on them you must not lose sight of them until you have discovered where they are domiciled in London. After that I will take the matter in hand myself."  "At what hour do you wish me to start for Liverpool, sir?" asked Belton.  "First thing tomorrow morning," his master replied. "In the meantime you must, by hook or crook, obtain a police inspector’s, a sergeant’s and two constables’ uniforms with belts and helmets complete. Also I shall require three men in whom I can place absolute and implicit confidence. They must be big fellows with plenty of pluck and intelligence, and the clothes you get must fit them so that they shall not look awkward in them. They must also bring plain clothes with them, for I shall want two of them to undertake a journey to Ireland. They will each be paid a hundred pounds for the job, and to ensure their silence afterwards. Do you think you can find me the men without disclosing my connection with the matter?"  "I know exactly where to put my hand upon them, sir," remarked Belton, "and for the sum you mention it’s my belief they’d hold their tongues forever, no matter what pressure was brought to bear upon them."  "Very good. You had better communicate with them at once, and tell them to hold themselves in readiness for I may want them at any moment. On Friday night I shall probably attempt the job, and they can get back to town when and how they like.  "Very good sir. I’ll see about them this afternoon without fail."  Next morning, Belton left London for Liverpool, with the photograph of the mysterious Rooney in his pocketbook. Carne had spent the afternoon with a fashionable party at Hurlingham, and it was not until he returned to his house that he received the telegram he had instructed his valet to send him. It was short, and to the point.  Friends arrived. Reach Euston nine o’clock.  The station clocks wanted ten minutes of the hour when the hansom containing a certain asceticlooking curate drove into the yard. The clergyman paid his fare, and, having inquired the platform upon which the Liverpool express would arrive, strolled leisurely in that direction. He would have been a clever man who would have recognized in this unsophisticated individual either deformed Simon Carne of Park Lane, or the famous detective of Belverton Street.  Punctual almost to the moment the train put in an appearance and drew up beside the platform. A moment later the curate was engulfed in a sea of passengers. A bystander, had he been sufficiently observant to notice such a thing, would have been struck by the eager way in which he looked about him, and also by the way in which his manner changed directly he went forward to greet the person he was expecting. To all appearances they were both curates, but their social positions must have been widely different if their behavior to each other could have been taken as any criterion. The new arrival, having greeted his friend, turned to two gentlemen standing beside him, and after thanking them for their company during the journey, wished them a pleasant holiday in England, and bade them goodbye. Then, turning to his friend again, he led him along the platform towards the cab rank.  During the time Belton had been speaking to the two men just referred to, Carne had been studying their faces attentively. One, the taller of the pair, if his red hair and watery blue eyes went for anything, was evidently Maguire, the other was Rooney, the man of the photograph. Both were big, burly fellows, and Carne felt that if it ever came to a fight, they would be just the sort of men to offer a determined resistance.  Arm in arm the curates followed the Americans towards the cab rank. Reaching it, the latter called up a vehicle, placed the bags they carried upon the roof, and took their places inside. The driver had evidently received his instructions, for he drove off without delay. Carne at once called up another cab, into which Belton sprang without ceremony. Carne pointed to the cab just disappearing through the gates ahead.  "Keep that hansom in sight, cabby," he said: "but whatever you do don’t pass it."  "All right, sir," said the man, and immediately applied the whip to his horse.  When they turned into Seymour Street, scarcely twenty yards separated the two vehicles, and in this order they proceeded across the Euston Road, by way of Upper Woburn Place and Tavistock Square.  The cab passed through Bloomsbury Square, and turned down one of the thoroughfares leading therefrom, and made its way into a street flanked on either side by tall, gloomylooking houses. Leaning over the apron, Carne gazed up at the corner house, on which he could just see the plate setting forth the name of the street. What he saw there told him all he wanted to know.  They were in Bellamer Street, and it was plain to him that the man had determined to thrust themselves upon the hapless Mrs. Jeffreys. He immediately poked his umbrella through the shutter, and bade the cabman drive on to the next corner, and then pull up. As soon as the horse came to a standstill, Carne jumped out, and, bidding his companion drive home, crossed the street, and made his way back until he arrived at a spot exactly opposite the house entered by the two men.  His supposition that they intended to domicile themselves there was borne out by the fact that they had taken their luggage inside, and had dismissed their cab. There had been lights in two of the windows when the cab had passed, now a third was added, and this he set down as emanating from the room allotted to the new arrivals.  For upwards of an hour and a half Carne remained standing in the shadow of the opposite houses, watching the Jeffrey’s residence. The lights in the lower room had by this time disappeared and within ten minutes that on the first floor followed suit. Being convinced, in his own mind, that the inmates were safely settled for the night, he left the scene of his vigil, and, walking to the corner of the street, hailed a hansom and was driven home. On reaching No. Belverton Street, he found a letter lying on the hall table addressed to Klimo. It was in a woman’s handwriting, and it did not take him long to guess that it was from Mrs. Jeffreys. He opened it and read as follows:   "_Bellamer Street,_ "_Thursday Evening._  "DEAR MR. KLIMO,  "I am sending this to you to tell you that my worst suspicions have been realized. The two men whose coming I so dreaded, have arrived, and have taken up their abode with us. For my father’s sake I dare not turn them out, and tonight I have heard from my husband to say that he will be home on Saturday next. What is to be done? If something does not happen soon, they will commence their dastardly business in England, and then God help us all. My only hope is in Him and you.  "Yours ever gratefully,  "EILEEN JEFFREYS."   Carne folded up the letter with a grave face, and then let himself into Porchester House and went to bed to think out his plan of action. Next morning he was up betimes, and by the breakfast hour had made up his mind as to what he was going to do. He had also written and dispatched a note to the girl who was depending so much upon him. In it he told her to come and see him without fail that morning. His meal finished, he went to his dressingroom and attired himself in Klimo’s clothes, and shortly after ten o’clock entered the detective’s house. Halfanhour later Mrs. Jeffreys was ushered into his presence. As he greeted her he noticed that she looked pale and wan. It was evident she had spent a sleepless night.  "Sit down," he said, "and tell me what has happened since last I saw you."  "The most terrible thing of all has happened," she answered. "As I told you in my note, the men have reached England, and are now living in our house. You can imagine what a shock their arrival was to me. I did not know what to do. For my father’s sake I could not refuse them admittance, and yet I knew that I had no right to take them in during my husband’s absence. Be that as it may, they are there now, and tomorrow night George returns. If he discovers their identity, and suspects their errand, he will hand them over to the police without a second thought, and then we shall be disgraced forever. Oh, Mr. Klimo, you promised to help me, can you not do so? Heaven knows how badly I need your aid."  "You shall have it. Now listen to my instructions. You will go home and watch these men. During the afternoon they will probably go out, and the instant they do so, you must admit three of my servants and place them in some room where their presence will not be suspected by our enemies. A friend, who will hand you my card, will call later on, and as he will take command, you must do your best to help him in every possible way."  "You need have no fear of my not doing that," she said. "And I will be grateful to you till my dying day."  "Well, we’ll see. Now, goodbye."  After she had left him, Klimo returned to Porchester House and sent for Belton. He was out, it appeared, but within halfanhour he returned and entered his master’s presence.  "Have you discovered the bank?" asked Carne.  "Yes, sir, I have," said Belton. "But not till I was walked off my legs. The men are as suspicious as wild rabbits, and they dodged and played about so, that I began to think they’d get away from me altogether. The bank is the ’United Kingdom,’ Oxford Street branch."  "That’s right. Now what about the uniforms?"  "They’re quite ready, sir, helmets, tunics, belts and trousers complete."  "Well then, have them packed as I told you yesterday, and ready to proceed to Bellamer Street with the men, the instant we get the information that the folk we are after have stepped outside the house door."  "Very good, sir. And as to yourself?"  "I shall join you at the house at ten o’clock, or thereabouts. We must, if possible, catch them at their supper."  London was half through its pleasures that night, when a tall, militarylooking man, muffled in a large cloak, stepped into a hansom outside Porchester House, Park Lane, and drove off in the direction of Oxford Street. Though the business which was taking him out would have presented sufficient dangers to have deterred many men who consider themselves not wanting in pluck, it did not in the least oppress Simon Carne; on the contrary, it seemed to afford him no small amount of satisfaction. He whistled a tune to himself as he drove along the lamplit thoroughfares, and smiled as sweetly as a lover thinking of his mistress when he reviewed the plot he had so cunningly contrived.  He felt a glow of virtue as he remembered that he was undertaking the business in order to promote another’s happiness, but at the same time reflected that, if fate were willing to pay him fifty thousand pounds for his generosity, well, it was so much the better for him. Reaching Mudie’s Library, his coachman drove by the way of Hart Street into Bloomsbury Square, and later on turned into Bellamer Street.  At the corner he stopped his driver and gave him some instructions in a low voice. Having done so, he walked along the pavement as far as No. 14, where he came to a standstill. As on the last occasion that he had surveyed the house, there were lights in three of the windows, and from this illumination he argued that his men were at home. Without hesitation he went up the steps and rang the bell. Before he could have counted fifty it was opened by Mrs. Jeffreys herself, who looked suspiciously at the person she saw before her. It was evident that in the tall, wellmade man with irongrey moustache and dark hair, she did not recognize her elderly acquaintance, Klimo, the detective.  "Are you Mrs. Jeffreys?" asked the newcomer, in a low voice.  "I am," she answered. "Pray, what can I do for you?"  "I was told by a friend to give you this card."  He thereupon handed to her a card on which was written the one word "Klimo." She glanced at it, and, as if that magic name were sufficient to settle every doubt, beckoned to him to follow her. Having softly closed the door she led him down the passage until she arrived at a door on her right hand. This she opened and signed to him to enter. It was a room that was half office half library.  "I am to understand that you come from Mr. Klimo?" she said, trembling under the intensity of her emotion. "What am I to do?"  "First be as calm as you can. Then tell me where the men are with whom I have to deal."  "They are having their supper in the diningroom. They went out soon after luncheon, and only returned an hour ago."  "Very good. Now, if you will conduct me upstairs, I shall be glad to see if your father is well enough to sign a document I have brought with me. Nothing can be done until I have arranged that."  "If you will come with me I will take you to him. But we must go quietly, for the men are so suspicious that they send for me to know the meaning of every sound. I was dreadfully afraid your ring would bring them out into the hall."  Leading the way up the stairs she conducted him to a room on the first floor, the door of which she opened carefully. On entering, Carne found himself in a wellfurnished bedroom. A bed stood in the center of the room, and on this lay a man. In the dim light, for the gas was turned down till it showed scarcely a glimmer, he looked more like a skeleton than a human being. A long white beard lay upon the coverlet, his hair was of the same color, and the pallor of his skin more than matched both. That he was conscious was shown by the question he addressed to his daughter as they entered.  "What is it, Eileen?" he asked faintly. "Who is this gentleman, and why does he come to see me?"  "He is a friend, father," she answered. "One who has come to save us from these wicked men."  "God bless you, sir," said the invalid, and as he spoke he made as if he would shake him by the hand. Carne, however, checked him.  "Do not move or speak," he said, "but try and pull yourself together sufficiently to sign this paper."  "What is the document?"  "It is something without which I can take no sort of action. My instructions are to do nothing until you have signed it. You need not be afraid; it will not hurt you. Come, sir, there is no time to be wasted. If these rascals are to be got out of England our scheme must be carried out tonight."  "To do that I will sign anything. I trust your honor for its contents. Give me pen and ink."  His daughter supported him in her arms, while Carne dipped a pen in the bottle of ink he had brought with him and placed it in the tremulous fingers. Then, the paper being supported on a book, the old man laboriously traced his signature at the place indicated. When he had done so he fell back upon the pillow completely exhausted.  Carne blotted it carefully, then folded the paper up, placed it in his pocket and announced himself ready for the work. The clock upon the mantlepiece showed him that it was a quarter to eleven, so that if he intended to act that night he knew he must do so quickly. Bidding the invalid rest happy in the knowledge that his safety was assured, he beckoned the daughter to him.  "Go downstairs," he said in a whisper, "and make sure that the men are still in the dining room."  She did as he ordered her, and in a few moments returned with the information that they had finished their supper and had announced their intention of going to bed.  "In that case we must hurry," said Carne. "Where are my men concealed?"  "In the room at the end of that passage," was the girl’s reply.  "I will go to them. In the meantime you must return to the study downstairs, where we will join you in five minutes’ time. Just before we enter the room in which they are sitting, one of my men will ring the frontdoor bell. You must endeavor to make the fellows inside believe that you are trying to prevent us gaining admittance. We shall arrest you, and then deal with them. Do you understand?"  "Perfectly."  She slipped away, and Carne hastened to the room at the end of the passage. He scratched with his fingernail upon the door, and a second later it was opened by a sergeant of police. On stepping inside he found two constables and an inspector awaiting him. "Is all prepared, Belton?" he inquired.  "Quite prepared, sir."  "Then come along, and step as softly as you can."  As he spoke he took from his pocket a couple of papers, and led the way along the corridor and down the stairs. With infinite care they made their way along the hall until they reached the diningroom door, where Mrs. Jeffreys joined them. Then the street bell rang loudly, and the man who had opened the front door a couple of inches shut it with a bang. Without further hesitation Carne called upon the woman to stand aside, while Belton threw open the diningroom door.  "I tell you, sir, you are mistaken," cried the terrified woman.  "I am the best judge, of that," said Carne roughly, and then, turning to Belton, he added: "Let one of your men take charge of this woman."  On hearing them enter the two men they were in search of had risen from the chairs they had been occupying on either side of the fire, and stood side by side upon the hearthrug, staring at the intruders as if they did not know what to do.  "James Maguire and Patrick Wake Rooney," said Carne, approaching the two men, and presenting the papers he held in his hand, "I have here warrants, and arrest you both on a charge of being concerned in a Fenian plot against the wellbeing of Her Majesty’s Government. I should advise you to submit quietly. The house is surrounded, constables are posted at all the doors, and there is not the slightest chance of escape."  The men seemed too thunderstruck to do anything, and submitted quietly to the process of handcuffing. When they had been secured, Carne turned to the inspector and said:  "With regard to the other man who is ill upstairs, Septimus O’Grady, you had better post a man at his door."  "Very good, sir."  Then turning to Messrs. Maguire and Rooney, he said: "I am authorized by Her Majesty’s Government to offer you your choice between arrest and appearance at Bow Street, or immediate return to America. Which do you choose? I need not tell you that we have proof enough in our hands to hang the pair of you if necessary. You had better make up your minds as quickly as possible, for I have no time to waste."  The men stared at him in supreme astonishment.  "You will not prosecute us?"  "My instructions are, in the event of your choosing the latter alternative, to see that you leave the country at once. In fact, I shall conduct you to Kingstown myself tonight, and place you aboard the mailboat there."  "Well, so far as I can see, it’s Hobson’s choice," said Maguire. "I’ll pay you the compliment of saying that you’re smarter than I thought you’d be. How did you come to know we were in England?"  "Because your departure from America was cabled to us more than a week ago. You have been shadowed ever since you set foot ashore. Now passages have been booked for you on board the outgoing boat, and you will sail in her. First, however, it will be necessary for you to sign this paper, pledging yourselves never to set foot in England again."  "And supposing we do not sign it?"  "In that case I shall take you both to Bow Street forthwith, and you will come before the magistrates in the morning. You know what that will mean."  For some moments they remained silent. Then Maguire said sullenly: "Bedad, sir, since there’s nothing else for it, I consent."  "And so do I," said Rooney. "Where’s the paper?"  Carne handed them a formidablelooking document, and they read it in turn with ostentatious care. As soon as they had professed themselves willing to append their signatures to it, the sham detective took it to a writingtable at the other end of the room, and then ordered them to be unmanacled, so that they could come up in turn and sign. Had they been less agitated it is just possible they would have noticed that two sheets of blotting paper covered the context, and that only a small space on the paper, which was of a bluishgrey tint, was left uncovered.  Then placing them in charge of the police officials, Carne left the room and went upstairs to examine their baggage. Evidently he discovered there what he wanted to know, for when he returned to the room his face was radiant.  Halfanhour later they had left the house in separate cabs. Rooney was accompanied by Belton and one of his subordinates, now in plain clothes, while Carne and another took charge of Maguire. At Euston they found special carriages awaiting them, and the same procedure was adopted in Ireland. The journey to Queenstown proved entirely uneventful; not for one moment did the two men suspect the trick that was being played upon them; nevertheless, it was with illconcealed feelings of satisfaction that Carne and Belton bade them farewell upon the deck of the outwardbound steamer.  "Goodbye," said Maguire, as their captors prepared to pass over the side again. "An’ good luck to ye. I’ll wish ye that, for ye’ve treated us well, though it’s a scurvy trick ye’ve played us in turning us out of England like this. First, however, one question. What about O’Grady?"  "The same course will be pursued with him, as soon as he is able to move," answered the other. "I can’t say more."  "A word in your ear first," said Rooney. He leant towards Carne. "The girl’s a good one," he said. "An’ ye may do what ye can for her, for she knows naught of our business."  "I’ll remember that if ever the chance arises," said Carne. "Now, goodbye."  "Goodbye."  On the Wednesday morning following, an elderly gentleman, dressed in rather an antiquated fashion, but boasting an appearance of great respectability, drove up in a brougham to the branch of the United Kingdom Bank in Oxford Street, and presented a cheque for no less a sum than fortyfive thousand pounds, signed with the names of Septimus O’Grady, James Maguire, and Patrick Rooney, and bearing the date of the preceding Friday.  The cheque was in perfect order, and, in spite of the largeness of the amount, it was cashed without hesitation.  That afternoon Klimo received a visit from Mrs. Jeffreys. She came to express her gratitude for his help, and to ask the extent of her debt.  "You owe me nothing but your gratitude. I will not take a halfpenny. I am quite well enough rewarded now," said Klimo with a smile.  When she had gone he took out his pocketbook and consulted it.  "Fortyfive thousand pounds," he said with a chuckle. "Yes, that is good. I did not take her money, but I have been rewarded in another way."  Then he went into Porchester House and dressed for the Garden Party at Marlborough House, to which he had been invited.      *CHAPTER VI.*   *A VISIT IN THE NIGHT.*   One bright summer morning Simon Carne sat in his study, and reflected on the slackness of things in general. Since he had rendered such a signal service to the State, as narrated in the previous chapter, he had done comparatively nothing to raise himself in his own estimation. He was thinking in this strain when his butler entered, and announced "Kelmare Sahib." The interruption was a welcome one, and Carne rose to greet his guest with every sign of pleasure on his face.  "Goodmorning, Kelmare," he said, as he took the other’s outstretched hand; "I’m delighted to see you. How are you this morning?"  "As well as a man can hope to be under the circumstances," replied the new arrival, a somewhat _blasé_ youth, dressed in the height of fashion. "You are going to the Greenthorpe wedding, of course. I hear you have been invited."  "You are quite right; I have," said Carne, and presently produced a card from the basket, and tossed it across the table.  The other took it up with a groan.  "Yes," he said, "that’s it, by Jove! And a nicelooking document it is. Carne, did you ever hate anybody so badly that it seemed as if it would be scarcely possible to discover anything you would not do to hurt them?"  "No," answered Carne, "I cannot say that I have. Fate has always found me some way or another in which I might get even with my enemies. But you seem very vindictive in this matter. What’s the reason of it?"  "Vindictive!" said Kelmare, "of course I am; think how they have treated me. A year ago, this week, Sophie Greenthorpe and I were engaged. Old Greenthorpe had not then turned his business into a limited liability company, and my people were jolly angry with me for making such a foolish match; but I did not care. I was in love, and Sophie Greenthorpe is as pretty a girl as can be found in the length and breadth of London. But there, you’ve seen her, so you know for yourself. Well, three months later, old Greenthorpe sold his business for upwards of three million sterling. On the strength of it he went into the House, gave thirty thousand to the funds of his party, and would have received a baronetcy for his generosity, had his party not been shunted out of power.  "Inside another month all the swells had taken them up; dukes and earls were as common at the old lady’s receptions as they had been scarce before and I began to understand that, instead of being everybody to them as I had once been, the old fellow was beginning to think his daughter might have done much better than become engaged to the third son of an impecunious earl.  "Then Kilbenham came upon the scene. He’s a finelooking fellow and a marquis, but, as you know as well as I do, a real bad hat. He hasn’t a red cent in the world to bless himself with, and he wanted moneywelljust about as badly as a man _could_ want it. What’s the result? Within six weeks I am thrown over, and she has accepted Kilbenham’s offer of marriage. Society says’What a good match!’ and, as if to endorse it, you receive an invitation to the ceremony."  "Forgive me, but you are growing cynical now," said Carne, as he lit a fresh cigar.  "Haven’t I good cause to be?" asked Kelmare. "Wait till you’ve been treated as I have, and then we’ll see how you’ll feel. When I think how every man you meet speaks of Kilbenham, and of the stories that are afloat concerning him, and hear the way old Greenthorpe and his pretensions are laughed at in the clubs, and sneered at in the papers, and am told that they are receiving presents of enormous value from all sorts and conditions of people, from Royalty to the poor devils of workmen he still underpays just because Kilbenham is a marquis and she is the daughter of a millionaire, why, I can tell you it is enough to make any one cynical."  "In the main, I agree with you," said Carne. "But, as life is made up of just such contradictions, it seems to me absurd to butt your head against a stone wall, and then grumble because it hurts and you don’t make any impression on it. Do you think the presents are as wonderful as they say? I want to know, because I’ve not given mine yet. In these days one gives as others give. If they have not received anything very good, then a pair of electroplated entrée dishes will meet the case. If the reversewelldiamonds, perhaps, or an old Master that the Americans are wild to buy, and can’t."  "Who is cynical now, I should like to know?" said Kelmare. "I was told this morning that up to the present, with the superb diamonds given by the bride’s father, they have totalled a value of something like twenty thousand pounds."  "You surprise me," answered Carne.  "I am surprised myself," said Kelmare, as he rose to go. "Now, I must be off. I came in to see if you felt inclined for a week’s cruise in the Channel. Burgrave has lent me his yacht, and somehow I think a change of air will do me good."  "I am very sorry," said Carne, "but it would be quite impossible for me to get away just now. I have several important functions on hand that will keep me in town."  "I suppose this wedding is one of them?"  "To tell the honest truth, I had scarcely thought of it," replied Carne. "Must you be off? Well, then, goodbye."  When Kelmare had disappeared, Carne went back to his study, and seated himself at his writingtable. "Kelmare is a little oversensitive," he said, "and his pique is spoiling his judgment. He does not seem to realize that he has come very well out of a jolly bad business. I am not certain which I pity mostMiss Greenthorpe, who is a heartless little hussy, or the Marquis of Kilbenham who is a thoroughpaced scoundrel. The wedding, however, promises to be a fashionable one, and"  He stopped midway, rose, and stood against the mantelpiece, staring into the empty fireplace. Presently he flipped the ash of his cigar, and turned round. "It never struck me in that light before," he said, as he pressed the button of the electric bell in the wall beside him. When it was answered, he ordered his carriage, and a quarter of an hour later was rolling down Regent Street.  Reaching a wellknown jeweler’s shop, he pulled the check string, and, the door having been opened, descended, and went inside. It was not the first time he had had dealings with the firm, and as soon as he was recognized the proprietor hastened forward himself to wait upon him.  "I want a nice wedding present for a young lady," he said, when the other had asked what he could have the pleasure of showing him. "Diamonds, I think, for preference."  A tray containing hairpins, brooches, rings, and aigrettes set with stones was put before him, but Carne was not satisfied. He wanted something better, he saidsomething a little more imposing. When he left the shop a quarter of an hour later he had chosen a diamond bracelet, for which he had paid the sum of one thousand pounds.  As Carne rolled down the street, he took the bracelet from its case and glanced at it. He had long since made up his mind as to his line of action, and having done so, was now prepared to start business without delay. On leaving the shop, he had ordered his coachman to drive home; but on second thoughts he changed his mind, and, once more pulling the check string, substituted Berkeley Square for Park Lane.  "I must be thoroughly convinced in my own mind," he said "before I do anything, and the only way to do that will be to see old Greenthorpe himself without delay. I think I have a good and sufficient excuse in my pocket. At any rate, I’ll try it."  On reaching the residence in question, he instructed his footman to inquire whether Mr. Greenthorpe was at home, and if so, if he would see him. An answer in the affirmative was soon forthcoming, and a moment later Carne and Greenthorpe were greeting each other in the library.  "Delighted to see you, my dear sir," the latter said as he shook his guest warmly by the hand, at the same time hoping that old Sir Mowbray Mowbray next door, who was a gentleman of the old school, and looked down on the plutocracy, could see and recognize the magnificent equipage standing before his house. "This is most kind of you, and indeed I take it as most friendly too."  Carne’s face was as smiling and fascinating as it was wont to be, but an acute observer might have read in the curves of his lips a little of the contempt he felt for the man before him. Matthew Greenthorpe’s face and figure betrayed his origin as plainly as any words could have done. If this had not been sufficient, his dress and the profusion of jewelryprincipally diamondsthat decked his person would have told the tale. In appearance he was short, stout, very red about the face, and made up what he lacked in breeding by an effusive familiarity that sometimes bordered on the offensive.  "I am afraid," said Carne, when his host had finished speaking, "that I ought to be ashamed of myself for intruding on you at such an early hour. I wanted, however, to thank you personally for the kind invitation you have sent me to be present at your daughter’s wedding."  "I trust you will be able to come," replied Mr. Greenthorpe a little anxiously, for he was eager that the world should know that he and the now famous Simon Carne were on familiar terms.  "That is exactly what has brought me to see you," said Carne. "I regret to say I hardly know yet whether I shall be able to give myself that pleasure or not. An important complication has arisen in connection with some property in which I am interested, and it is just possible that I shall be called to the Continent within the next few days. My object in calling upon you this morning was to ask you to permit me to withhold my answer until I am at liberty to speak more definitely as to my arrangements."  "By all means, by all means," answered his host, placing himself with legs wide apart upon the hearthrug, and rattling the money in his trouser pockets. "Take just as long as you like so long as you don’t say you can’t come. Me and the missushem!I mean Mrs. Greenthorpe and Iare looking forward to the pleasure of your society, and I can tell you we sha’n’t think our company complete if we don’t have you with us."  "I am extremely flattered," said Carne sweetly, "and you may be sure it will not be my fault if I am not among your guests."  "Hear, hear, to that, sir," replied the old gentleman. "We shall be a merry party, and, I trust, a distinguished one. We _did_ hope to have had Royalty present among us, but, unfortunately, there were special reasons, that I am hardly privileged to mention, which prevented it. However, the Duke of Rugby and his Duchess, the father and mother of my future soninlaw, you know, are coming; the Earl of Boxmoor and his countess have accepted; Lord Southam and his lady, halfadozen baronets or so, and as many Members of Parliament and their wives as you can count on one hand. There’ll be a ball the night before, given by the Mayor at the Assembly Rooms, a dinner to the tenants at the conclusion of the ceremony, and a ball in my own house after the young couple have gone away. You may take it from me, my dear sir, that nothing on a similar scale has even been seen at Market Stopford before."  "I can quite believe it," said Carne. "It will mark an epoch in the history of the country."  "It will do more than that, sir. The festivities alone will cost me a cool five thousand pounds. At first _I_ was all for having it in town, but I was persuaded out of it. After all, a country house is better suited to such jinks. And we mean to do it well."  He took Carne familiarly by the button of his coat, and, sinking his voice to an impressive whisper, asked him to hazard a guess how much the whole affair, presents and all, would cost.  Carne shook his head. "I have not the very remotest notion," he said. "But if you wish me to guess, I will put it at fifty thousand pounds."  "Not enough by half, sirnot enough by half. Why, I’ll let you into a secret that even my wife knows nothing about."  As he spoke, he crossed the room to a large safe in the wall. This he unlocked and having done so took from it an oblong box, wrapped in tissue paper. This he placed on the table in the center of the room, and then, having looked out into the hall to make sure that no one was about, shut and locked the door. Then, turning to Carne, he said:  "I don’t know what you may think, sir, but there are some people I know as try to insinuate that if you have money you can’t have taste. Now, I’ve got the money"here he threw back his shoulders, and tapped himself proudly on the chest"and I’m going to convince you, sir, that I’ve got as pretty an idea of taste as any man could wish to have. This box will prove it."  So saying he unwrapped the tissue paper, and displayed to Carne’s astonished gaze a large gilded casket, richly chased, standing upon four massive feet.  "There, sir, you see," he said, "an artistic bit of workmanship, and I’ll ask you to guess what it’s for."  Carne, however, shook his head. "I’m afraid I’m but a poor hand at guessing, but, if I must venture an opinion, I should say a jewel case."  Thereupon Mr. Greenthorpe lifted the lid.  "And you would be wrong, sir. I will tell you what it is for. That box has been constructed to contain exactly fifty thousand sovereigns and on her wedding day it will be filled, and presented to the bride, as a token of her father’s affection. Now, if that isn’t in good taste, I shall have to ask you to tell me what is."  "I am astonished at your munificence," said Carne. "To be perfectly candid with you, I don’t know that I have ever heard of such a present before."  "I thought you’d say so. I said to myself when I ordered that box, ’Mr. Carne is the best judge of what is artistic in England, and I’ll take his opinion about it.’"  "I suppose your daughter has received some valuable presents?"  "Valuable, sir? Why, that’s no name for it. I should put down what has come in up to the present at, not a penny under twenty thousand pounds. Why, you may not believe it, sir, but Mrs. Greenthorpe has presented the young couple with a complete toiletset of solid gold. I doubt if such another has been seen in this country before."  "I should say it would be worth a burglar’s while to pay a visit to your house on the wedding day," said Carne with a smile.  "He wouldn’t get much for his pains," said the old gentleman warmly. "I have already provided for that contingency. The billiardroom will be used as a treasurechamber for the time being, as there is a big safe like that over yonder in the wall. This week bars are being placed on all the windows, and on the night preceding, and also on the wedding day, one of my gardeners will keep watch in the room itself, while one of the village policemen will mount guard at the door in the passage. Between them they ought to be sufficient to keep out any burglars who may wish to try their hands upon the presents. What do you think?"  At that moment the handle of the door turned, and an instant later the brideelect entered the room. On seeing Simon Carne she paused upon the threshold with a gesture of embarrassment, and made as if she would retreat. Carne, however, was too quick for her. He advanced and held out his hand.  "How do you do, Miss Greenthorpe," he said, looking her steadily in the face. "You father has just been telling me of the many beautiful presents you have received. I am sure I congratulate you most heartily. With your permission I will add my mite to the list. Such as it is, I would beg your acceptance of it."  So saying, he took from his pocket the case containing the bracelet he had that morning purchased. Unfastening it, he withdrew the circlet and clasped it upon her wrist. So great was her surprise and delight that for some moments she was at a loss how to express her thanks. When she recovered her presence of mind and her speech, she attempted to do so, but Carne stopped her.  "You must not thank me too much," he said, "or I shall begin to think I have done a meritorious action. I trust Lord Kilbenham is well?"  "He was very well when I last saw him," answered the girl after a momentary pause, which Carne noticed, "but he is so busy just now that we see very little of each other. Goodbye."  All the way home Simon Carne sat wrapped in a brown study. On reaching his residence he went straight to his study, and to his writingdesk, where he engaged himself for some minutes jotting down certain memoranda on a sheet of notepaper. When he had finished he rang the bell and ordered that Belton, his valet, should be sent to him.  "Belton," he said, when the person he wanted had arrived in answer to the summons, "on Thursday next I shall go down to Market Stopford to attend the wedding of the Marquis of Kilbenham with Miss Greenthorpe. You will, of course, accompany me. In the meantime" (here he handed him the sheet of paper upon which he had been writing) "I want you to attend to these few details. Some of these articles, I’m afraid, you will find rather difficult to obtain, but at any cost I must have them to take down to the country with me."  Belton took the paper and left the room with it, and for the time being Carne dismissed the matter from his mind. The sun was in the act of setting on the day immediately preceding the wedding when Simon Carne and his faithful valet reached the wayside station of Market Stopford. As the train came to a standstill, a footman wearing the Greenthorpe livery opened the door of the reserved carriage and informed his master’s guest that a brougham was waiting outside the station to convey him to his destination. Belton was to follow with the luggage in the servants’ omnibus.  On arrival at Greenthorpe Park, Simon Carne was received by his host and hostess in the hall, the rearmost portion of which was furnished as a smokingroom. Judging from the number of guests passing, repassing, and lolling about in the easy chairs, most of the company invited had already arrived. When he had greeted those with whom he was familiar, and had taken a cup of tea from the hands of the brideelect, who was dispensing it at a small table near the great oak fireplace, he set himself to be agreeable to those about him for the space of a quarter of an hour, after which he was escorted to his bedroom, a pretty room situated in the main portion of the building at the head of the grand staircase. He found Belton awaiting him there. His luggage had been unpacked, and a glance at his watch told him that it would be necessary for him to prepare for dinner.  "Well, Belton," he said, as he threw himself into a chair beside the window that looked out over the rose garden, "here we are, and the next question is, how are we going to succeed?"  "I have never known you to fail yet, sir," replied the deferential valet, "and I don’t suppose you’ll do so on this occasion."  "You flatter me, Belton, but I will not be so falsely modest as to say that your praise is altogether undeserved. This, however, is a case of more than usual delicacy and danger, and it will be necessary for us to play our cards with considerable care. When I have examined this house I shall elaborate my plans more fully. We have none too much time, for the attempt must be made tomorrow night. You have brought down with you the things I mentioned on that list, I suppose?"  "They are in these chests, sir," said Belton. "They make a precious heavy load, and once or twice I was fearful lest they might arouse suspicion."  "You need have no fear, my good Belton," said Carne. "I have a very plausible excuse to account for their presence here. Everyone by this time knows that I am a great student, and also that I never travel without at least two cases of books. It is looked upon as a harmless fad. Here is my key. Open the box standing nearest to you."  Belton did as he was commanded, when it was seen that it was filled to its utmost holding capacity with books.  "No one would think," said Carne, with a smile at the astonishment depicted on the other’s face, "that there are only two layers of volumes there, would they? If you lift out the tray upon which they rest, you will discover that the balance of the box is now occupied by the things you placed in it. Unknown to you, I had the trays fitted after you had packed the others. There is nothing like being prepared for all emergencies. Now pay attention to what I am about to say to you. I have learned that the wedding presents, including the fifty thousand sovereigns presented by Mr. Greenthorpe to his daughter in that absurd casket, of which I spoke to you, will be on view tomorrow afternoon in the billiardroom; tonight, and tomorrow before the ball commences, they will be placed in the safe. One of Mr. Greenthorpe’s most trusted servants will keep watch over them in the room, while a constable will be on duty in the lobby outside. Bars have been placed on all windows, and, as I understand, the village police will patrol the building at intervals during the night. The problem of how we are to get hold of them would seem rather a hard nut to crack, would it not?"  "I must confess I don’t see how you are going to do it at all, sir," said Belton.  "Well, we’ll see. I have a plan in my head now, but before I can adopt it I must make a few inquiries. I believe there is a staircase leading from the end of this corridor down to the lobby outside the billiard and smokingrooms. If this is so, we shall have to make use of it. It must be your business to discover at what time the custodians of the treasure have their last meal. When you have found that out let me know. Now you had better get me ready for dinner as soon as possible."  When Carne retired to rest that evening, his inimitable valet was in a position to report that the sentries were already installed, and that their supper had been taken to them, by Mr. Greenthorpe’s orders, at ten o’clock precisely, by one of the underfootmen, who had been instructed to look after them.  "Very good," said Carne; "I think I see my way now. I’ll sleep on my scheme and let you know what decision I have come to in the morning. If we pull this little business off successfully, there will be ten thousand pounds for you to pay into your credit, my friend."  Belton bowed and thanked his master without a sign of emotion upon his face. After which Simon Carne went to bed.  When he was called next morning, he discovered a perfect summer day. Brilliant sunshine streamed in at the windows, and the songs of the birds came Iron the trees outside.  "An excellent augury," he said to himself as he jumped out of bed and donned the heavy dressinggown his valet held open for him. "Miss Greenthorpe, my compliments to you. My lord marquis is not the only man upon whom you are conferring happiness today."  His good humor did not leave him, for when he descended to the breakfastroom an hour later his face was radiant with smiles, and every one admitted that it would be impossible to meet a more charming companion.  During the morning he was occupied in the library, writing letters.  At one he lunched with his fellowguests, none of the family being present, and at halfpast went off to dress for the wedding ceremony. This important business completed, a move was made for the church; and in something less than a quarter of an hour the nuptial knot was tied, and Miss Sophie Greenthorpe, only daughter of Matthew Greenthorpe, erstwhile grocer and provision merchant of Little Bexter Street, Tottenham Court Road, left the building, on her husband’s arm, Marchioness of Kilbenham and future Duchess of Rugby.  Simon Carne and his fellowguests followed in her wake down the aisle, and, having entered their carriages, returned to the Park.  The ball that evening was an acknowledged success, but, though he was an excellent dancer, and had his choice of the prettiest women in the room, Carne was evidently ill at ease. The number of times he stealthily examined his watch said this as plainly as any words. As a matter of fact, the last guest had scarcely arrived before he left the ballroom, and passed down the lobby towards the back staircase, stopping _en route_ to glance at the billiardroom door.  As he expected, it was closed, and a stalwart provincial policeman stood on guard before it.  He made a jocular reference about the treasure the constable was guarding, and, with a laugh at himself for forgetting the way to his bedroom, retraced his steps to the stairs, up which he passed to his own apartment. Belton was awaiting him there.  "It is ten minutes to ten, Belton," he said abruptly. "It must be now or never. Go down to the kitchen, and hang about there until the tray upon which the suppers of the guard are placed is prepared. When the footman starts with it for the Billiardroom, accompany him, and as he opens the green baize door leading into the house, manage by hook or crook, to hold him in conversation. Say something, and interrupt yourself by a severe fit of coughing. That will give me my cue. If anything should happen to me as I come downstairs, be sure that the man puts his tray down on the slab at the foot of the stairs and renders me assistance. I will manage the rest. Now be off."  Belton bowed respectfully and left the room. As he did so, Carne crossed to the dressingtable, and unlocked a small case standing upon it. From this he took a tiny silverstoppered scent bottle, containing, perhaps, half an ounce of white powder. This he slipped into his waistcoat pocket, and then made for the door.  On the top of the back staircase he paused for a few moments to listen. He heard the spring of the green baize door in the passage below creak as it was pushed open. Next moment he distinguished Belton’s voice. "It’s true as I’m standing here," he was saying. "As I went up the stairs with the governor’s hot water there she was coming along the passage. I stood back to let her pass, and as I did she" (Here the narrative was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing.) On hearing this Carne descended the stairs, and, when he had got halfway down, saw the footman and his valet coming along the passage below. At the same instant he must have caught his foot in the stair carpet, for he tripped and fell headlong to the bottom.  "Heavens live!" cried Belton. "I do believe that’s my governor, and he’s killed." At the same time he ran forward to the injured man’s assistance.  Carne lay at the foot of the stairs just as he had fallen, his head thrown back, his eyes shut, and his body curled up and motionless. Belton turned to the footman, who still stood holding the tray where he had stopped on seeing the accident, and said: "Put down those things and go and find Mr. Greenthorpe as quickly as you can. Tell him Mr. Carne has fallen downstairs, and I’m afraid is seriously injured."  The footman immediately disappeared. His back was scarcely turned, however, before Carne was on his feet.  "Excellent, my dear Belton," he whispered; and, as he spoke, he slipped his fingers into his waistcoat pocket. "Hand me up that tray, but be quiet, or the policeman round the corner will hear you."  Belton did as he was ordered, and Carne thereupon sprinkled upon the suppers provided for the two men some of the white powder from the bottle he had taken from his dressingcase. This done, he resumed his place at the foot of the stairs, while Belton, kneeling over him and supporting his head, waited for assistance. Very few minutes elapsed before Mr. Greenthorpe, with his scared face, appeared upon the scene. At his direction Belton and the footman carried the unconscious gentleman to his bedroom, and placed him upon his bed. Restoratives were administered and in something under ten minutes the injured man once more opened his eyes.  "What is the matter?" he asked feebly. "What has happened?"  "You have met with a slight accident, my dear sir," said the old gentleman, "but you are better now. You fell downstairs."  As if he scarcely comprehended what was said, Carne feebly repeated the last sentence after his host, and then closed his eyes again. When he opened them once more, it was to beg Mr. Greenthorpe to leave him and return to his guests downstairs. After a small amount of pressing, the latter consented to do so, and retired, taking the footman with him. The first use Carne made of their departure was to turn to Belton.  "The powder will take effect in five hours," he said. "See that you have all the things prepared."  "They are quite ready," replied Belton. "I arranged them this evening."  "Very good," said Carne. "Now, I am going to sleep in real earnest."  So saying, he closed his eyes, and resigned himself to slumber as composedly as if nothing out of the common had occurred. The clock on the stables had struck three when he woke again. Belton was still sleeping peacefully, and it was not until he had been repeatedly shaken that he became conscious that it was time to get up.  "Wake up," said Carne; "it is three o’clock, and time for us to be about our business. Unlock that box, and get out the things."  Belton did as he was ordered, placing the packets as he took them from the case in small Gladstone bags. Having done this, he went to one of his master’s trunks, and took from it two suits of clothes, a pair of wigs, two excellently contrived false beards, and a couple of soft felt hats. These he placed upon the bed. Ten minutes later he had assisted his master to change into one of the suits, and when this was done waited for further instructions.  "Before you dress, take a tumbler from that table, and go downstairs. If you should meet anyone, say that you are going to the butler’s pantry in search of filtered water, as you have used all the drinking water in this room. The ball should be over by this time, and the guests in bed halfanhour ago. Ascertain if this is the case, and as you return glance at the policeman on duty outside the billiardroom door. Let me know his condition."  "Very good, sir," said Belton; and, taking a tumbler from the table in question, he left the room. In less than five minutes he had returned to report that, with the exception of the corridor outside the billiardroom, the house was in darkness.  "And how is the guardian of the door?" Carne inquired.  "Fast asleep," said Belton, "and snoring like a pig, sir."  "That is right," said Carne. "The man inside should be the same, or that powder has failed me for the first time in my experience. We’ll give them halfanhour longer, however, and then get to work. You had better dress yourself."  While Belton was making himself up to resemble his master, Carne sat in an easy chair by his dressingtable, reading Ruskin’s _Stones of Venice_. It was one of the most important of his many peculiarities that he could withdraw his thoughts from any subject, however much it might hitherto have engrossed him, and fasten them upon another, without once allowing them to wander back to their original channel. As the stable clock chimed the halfhour, he put the book aside, and sprang to his feet.  "If you’re ready, Belton," he said, "switch off the electric light and open that door."  When this had been done he bade his valet wait in the bedroom while he crept down the stairs on tiptoe. On turning into the billiardroom lobby, he discovered the rural policeman propped up in the corner fast asleep. His heavy breathing echoed down the corridors, and one moment’s inspection showed Carne that from him he had nothing to fear. Unlocking the door with a key which he took from his pocket, he entered the room, to find the gardener, like the policeman, fast asleep in an armchair by the window. He crossed to him, and, after a careful examination of his breathing, lifted one of his eyelids.  "Excellent," he said. "Nothing could be better. Now, when Belton comes, we shall be ready for business."  So saying he left the room again, and went softly up the stairs to find his valet. The latter was awaiting him, and, before a witness, had there been one, could have counted twenty, they were standing in the billiardroom together. It was a large apartment, luxuriously furnished, with a bow window at one end and an alcove, surrounded with seats, at the other. In this alcove, cleverly hidden by the wainscoting, as Mr. Greenthorpe had once been at some pains to point out to Simon Carne, there existed a large iron safe of the latest burglarproof pattern.  The secret was an ingenious one, and would have baffled any ordinary craftsman. Carne, however, as has already been explained, was far from being a commonplace member of his profession. Turning to Belton, he said, "Give me the tools." These being forthcoming, in something less than ten minutes he had picked the lock and was master of the safe’s contents.  When these, including the fifty thousand sovereigns, had been safely carried upstairs and stowed away in the portmanteaux and chests, and the safe had been filled with the spurious jewelry he had brought with him for that purpose, he signed to Belton to bring him a long pair of steps which stood in a corner of the room, and which had been used for securing the skylight above the billiardtable. These he placed in such a position as would enable him to reach the window.  With a diamondpointed instrument, and a hand as true as the eye that guided it, he quickly extracted a square of colored glass, filed through the catch, and was soon standing on the leads outside. A few moments later, the ladder, which had already rendered him such signal service, had enabled him to descend into the garden on the other side.  There he arranged a succession of footsteps in the soft mould, and having done so, returned to the roof, carefully wiped the end of the ladder, so that it should not betray him, and climbed down into the room below, pulling it after him.  "I think we have finished now," he said to Belton, as he took a last look at the recumbent guardians of the room. "These gentlemen sleep soundly, so we will not disturb them further. Come, let us retire to bed."  In less than halfanhour he was in bed and fast asleep. Next morning he was still confined to his room by his accident, though he expressed himself as suffering but slight pain. Every one was quick to sympathize with him, and numerous messages were conveyed to him expressive of sorrow that he should have met with his accident at such a time of general rejoicing. At ten o’clock the first batch of guests took their departure. It was arranged that the Duke and Duchess of Rugby, the Earl and Countess of Raxter, and Simon Carne, who was to be carried downstairs, should travel up to town together by the special train leaving immediately after lunch.  When they bade their host goodbye, the later was nearly overcome.  "I’m sure it has been a real downright pleasure to me to entertain you, Mr. Carne," he said, as he stood by the carriage door and shook his guest warmly by the hand. "There is only one thing bad about it, and that is your accident."  "You must not speak of that," said Carne, with a little wave of his hand. "The pleasure I have derived from my visit to you amply compensates me for such a minor inconvenience."  So saying he shook hands and drove away to catch his train.  Next morning it was announced in all the Society papers that, owing to an unfortunate accident he had sustained while visiting Mr. Matthew Greenthorpe, at Greenthorpe Park, on the occasion of his daughter’s marriage, Mr. Simon Carne would be unable to fulfill any of the engagements he might have entered into.  Any intelligent reader of the aforesaid papers might have been excused had he pictured the gentleman in question confined to his bed tended by skilled nurses, and watched over by the most fashionable West End physicians obtainable for love or money. They would doubtless, therefore, have been surprised could they have seen him at a late hour on the following evening hard at work in the laboratory he had constructed at the top of his house, as hale and hearty a man as any to be found in the great Metropolis.  "Now those Apostle spoons," he was saying, as he turned from the crucible at which he was engaged to Belton, who was busy at a side table. "The diamonds are safely disposed of, their settings are melted down, and, when these spoons have been added to the list, he will be a wise man who can find in my possession any trace of the famous KilbenhamGreenthorpe wedding presents."  He was sitting before the fire in his study next morning, with his left foot lying bound up upon a neighboring chair, when Ram Gafur announced "Kelmare Sahib."  "So sorry to hear that you are under the weather Carne," said the newcomer as he shook hands. "I only heard of your accident from Baxter last night or I should have been round before. Beastly hard luck, but you shouldn’t have gone to the wedding, you know!"  "And, pray, why not?"  "You see for yourself you haven’t profited by your visit, have you?"  "That all depends upon what you consider profit," replied Carne. "I was an actor in an interesting Society spectacle. I was permitted an opportunity of observing my fellowcreatures in many new lights. Personally, I think I did very well. Besides that, to be laid up just now is not altogether a thing to be despised, as you seem to imagine."  "What do you mean?"  "It isn’t everybody who can boast such a valid excuse for declining invitations as I now possess," said Carne. "When I tell you that I had a dinner, a lecture at the Imperial institute, two ’at homes,’ and three dances on my list for tonight, you will understand what I mean. Now I am able to decline every one of them without risk of giving offense or fear of hurting the susceptibilities of any one. If you don’t call that luck, I do. And now tell me what has brought you here, for I suppose you have some reason, other than friendship, for this early call. When you came in I observed that you were bursting with importance. You are not going to tell me that you have abandoned your yachting trip and are going to get married?"  "You need have no fear on that score. All the same, I have the greatest and most glorious news for you. It isn’t every day a man finds Providence taking up his case and entering into judgment against his enemies for him. That is my position. Haven’t you heard the news?"  "What news?" asked Carne innocently.  "The greatest of all possible news," answered Kelmare, "and one which concerns you, my dear fellow. You may not believe it, but it was discovered last evening that the KilbenhamGreenthorpe wedding presents have all been stolen, including the fifty thousand sovereigns presented to the bride in the now famous jeweled casket. What do you think of that?"  "Surely you must be joking," said Carrie incredulously. "I cannot believe it."  "Nevertheless it’s a fact," replied Kelmare.  "But when did it happen? and how did they discover it?" asked Carne.  "When it took place nobody can tell, but they discovered it when they came to put the presents together after the guests had departed. On the morning after the wedding old Greenthorpe had visited the safe himself, and glanced casually at its contents, just to see that they were all right, you know; but it was not until the afternoon, when they began to do them up, that they discovered that every single article of value the place contained had been abstracted, and dummies substituted. Their investigation proved that the skylight had been tampered with, and one could see unmistakable footmarks on the flower beds outside."  "Good gracious!" said Carne. "This is news indeed. What a haul the thieves must have had, to be sure. I can scarcely believe it even now. But I thought they had a gardener in the room, a policeman at the door, and a patrol outside, and that old Greenthorpe went to sleep with the keys of the room and safe under his pillow?"  "Quite right," said Kelmare, "so he did; that’s the mysterious part of it. The two chaps swear positively that they were wide awake all night, and that nothing was tampered with while they were there. Who the thieves were, and how they became so familiar with the place are riddles that it would puzzle the Sphinx, or your friend Klimo next door, to unravel."  "What an unfortunate thing," said Carne. "It’s to be hoped the police will catch them before they have time to dispose of their booty."  "You are thinking of your bracelet, I suppose?"  "It may seem egotistical, but I must confess I was; and now I suppose you’ll stay to lunch?"
